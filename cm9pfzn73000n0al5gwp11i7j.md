## 🗂️ System Updates and Repositories

### 📌 Concept

In Linux, **system updates and package installations** are managed through package managers and repositories. These tools help install software, manage dependencies, and maintain system stability by delivering updates and patches from **verified sources**.

## 📦 Common Package Managers

### ➤ `yum` (CentOS/RHEL 6 and earlier)

* **Used in legacy systems**
    
* Works with `.rpm` packages
    
* Automatically handles software dependencies
    
* Was the standard in RHEL 5, 6, and early RHEL 7
    

### ➤ `dnf` (CentOS/RHEL 8+ and Fedora)

* **Modern replacement** for `yum`
    
* Faster performance, better dependency resolution
    
* Supports modular content and rollback features
    
* Used in RHEL 8, 9 and Fedora systems
    

### ➤ `rpm`

* A **low-level tool** to install, query, or remove `.rpm` files
    
* Does **not handle dependencies**
    
* Used for manual, surgical package operations
    

## 🔁 Two Types of Upgrades in Linux

### 🧩 1. **Major Version Upgrade**

* Examples: RHEL 6 → 7, or 7 → 8
    
* Requires manual planning or tools like `leapp`
    
* Not done using `yum` or `dnf` directly
    
* Often involves kernel, architecture, init changes
    

### 🧩 2. **Minor Version Upgrade**

* Example: RHEL 7.3 → 7.4
    
* Achieved using:
    
    ```bash
    yum update
    ```
    
* Applies bug fixes, security patches, and minor enhancements
    

### ⚖️ `yum update` vs `yum upgrade`

| Command | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `yum update` | Updates all packages while preserving existing configurations |
| `yum upgrade` | Updates packages and removes obsolete/conflicting ones (cleaner system) |

## 🔧 Examples of Package Manager Usage

```bash
# List all available updates
sudo yum check-update

# Apply all updates
sudo yum update

# Install Apache HTTP Server
sudo yum install httpd

# Remove Apache HTTP Server
sudo yum remove httpd

# On newer systems (RHEL 8+)
sudo dnf install nginx

# On older systems
sudo yum install nginx
```

## 🧪 Real-Time Use Cases

### ✅ Scenario 1: Monthly Security Patch Automation

```bash
yum -y update --security
```

> Automates critical security patches on production servers

### ✅ Scenario 2: Quick Web Server Setup

```bash
dnf install -y httpd
systemctl enable --now httpd
```

> Instantly deploy a test Apache server for internal testing

### ✅ Scenario 3: Troubleshooting with `rpm`

```bash
rpm -qf /usr/bin/vim     # Find package owning the file
rpm -qi bash             # Show detailed package info
```

> Useful in debugging missing binaries or verifying source

## 🌐 What is a Repository?

A **repository** is a central storage of software packages. It can be:

* Online (public repos like EPEL, CentOS/RHEL official repos)
    
* Local (your own server with `.rpm` packages)
    

Repositories use metadata to track package versions, dependencies, and file locations.

## 📍 What is a Local Repository?

In **offline or air-gapped environments**, you can create your own local repo using `createrepo`.

This is useful when:

* Internet access is restricted
    
* You want to maintain **consistent package versions**
    
* You manage **many servers**
    

### 🛠️ How to Set Up a Local Repository

#### ✅ Step-by-step:

```bash
# Step 1: Install the required tools
sudo yum install createrepo -y

# Step 2: Prepare local RPM directory
mkdir -p /myrepo/packages
cp /mnt/cdrom/Packages/*.rpm /myrepo/packages/

# Step 3: Generate metadata
createrepo /myrepo/packages/

# Step 4: Create a local repo file
cat <<EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo
[localrepo]
name=Local Repository
baseurl=file:///myrepo/packages
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF
```

### 🔁 Syncing Repos from ISO (Optional)

```bash
mount /dev/cdrom /mnt
createrepo /mnt
```

> Enables package installations without Internet

## 💡 Real-World Example:

Your data center has 100 RHEL 8 VMs. Internet is blocked by a firewall. You:

* Create a local repository with all `.rpm` files
    
* Configure all VMs to point to this repo
    
* Apply updates using `yum` or `dnf` from the local repo
    

## 🧰 Mastering Package Operations

### 📦 **1\. Installing Packages**

Linux systems install software from pre-built `.rpm` packages using `yum`, `dnf`, or `rpm`.

#### ✅ Syntax:

```bash
sudo yum install <package-name>         # RHEL 6/7
sudo dnf install <package-name>         # RHEL 8/9
sudo rpm -ivh <package-file.rpm>        # Manual RPM install
```

#### 📌 Example:

```bash
sudo dnf install httpd
```

Installs the Apache web server along with all dependencies.

#### 💡 Real-World Use Case:

* **Scenario**: A sysadmin wants to set up a local web server for development.
    
    * **Solution**:
        
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install httpd
        sudo systemctl enable --now httpd
        ```
        

#### 🛠️ Troubleshooting:

* **Error**: `Error: Unable to find a match`
    
    * **Fix**: Check the repository config. Run `dnf repolist` to confirm repos are enabled.
        

### ⬆️ **2\. Upgrading Packages**

Used to upgrade installed packages to newer versions.

#### ✅ Syntax:

```bash
sudo yum update <package-name>      # Safer, preserves config
sudo dnf upgrade <package-name>     # Removes obsolete packages
```

#### 📌 Example:

```bash
sudo dnf upgrade nginx
```

#### 🧠 Real-World Insight:

* Use `update` in **production** (preserves existing settings).
    
* Use `upgrade` in **testing** (cleans obsolete packages, may break configs).
    

#### 🛠️ Troubleshooting:

* If the system behaves unexpectedly after an upgrade:
    
    * Roll back using `yum history undo <id>`.
        

### ❌ **3\. Deleting Packages**

Uninstalls software and associated files (not always all configs).

#### ✅ Syntax:

```bash
sudo yum remove <package-name>
sudo dnf remove <package-name>
```

#### 📌 Example:

```bash
sudo dnf remove httpd
```

#### 🧪 Real-World Use Case:

* Removing unused services to reduce attack surface or free up disk space.
    

#### ⚠️ Caution:

* Always review dependencies that will be removed. `yum remove` may show additional packages getting uninstalled.
    

### 🔍 **4\. View Package Details**

To learn more about a specific package: version, license, install date, dependencies, etc.

#### ✅ Syntax:

```bash
rpm -qi <package-name>
dnf info <package-name>
```

#### 📌 Example:

```bash
rpm -qi bash
dnf info nginx
```

#### 🧠 Real Use Case:

* Validating package versions before rolling out updates.
    

### 📂 **5\. Identify Source or Location**

Sometimes, we need to trace where a file came from.

#### ✅ Syntax:

```bash
rpm -qf /path/to/file
```

#### 📌 Example:

```bash
rpm -qf /usr/bin/vim
```

Tells you which package owns `/usr/bin/vim`.

#### 🧪 Real-World Use Case:

* **Scenario**: A suspicious binary is found. This command tells you if it’s part of an official package or not.
    

### ⚙️ **6\. Configuration Files of Packages**

Installed packages often include default config files. You can list them with:

#### ✅ Syntax:

```bash
rpm -qc <package-name>
```

#### 📌 Example:

```bash
rpm -qc sshd
```

Shows config paths like `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

#### 💡 Use Case:

* Quickly identify where to make changes for a specific package.
    

## 🧰 Advanced Package Management in Linux – **Rollback, Patch History, and Upgrade Strategies**

### 🔄 **1\. Rollback Updates and Patches**

Linux allows rollback of previously applied updates using the **yum history** command. This is especially useful when an update breaks functionality.

#### 📌 Syntax:

```bash
yum history           # View past transactions
yum history info <id> # View details of a specific transaction
yum history undo <id> # Rollback a specific transaction
```

#### 🧪 Example:

```bash
# Step 1: See transaction history
yum history

# Step 2: Undo a problematic transaction (e.g., ID 27)
yum history undo 27
```

#### 💡 Real-World Use Case:

* After a kernel patch, a server fails to boot into GUI.
    
    * Admin reboots into an older kernel, rolls back the latest kernel patch:
        
        ```bash
        yum history undo <kernel_patch_id>
        ```
        

#### ⚠️ Caution:

* **Only works if history data is intact**.
    
* Some rollbacks may not be fully reversible if packages are no longer available in the repo.
    

### 🧳 **2\. System Type Considerations: VM vs Physical Machine**

Rollback behavior may differ slightly depending on whether you're on a **virtual machine** or **bare-metal server**.

| System Type | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| Virtual Machine | Always take a snapshot before applying patches |
| Physical Machine | Use `yum history undo` cautiously; may need rescue |

### ⬇️ **3\. Downgrading a Package**

You can manually downgrade a package version if needed.

#### ✅ Syntax:

```bash
yum downgrade <package-name>
```

#### 📌 Example:

```bash
yum downgrade httpd
```

#### ⚠️ Not Recommended:

* **Downgrading the entire system** (e.g., from **RHEL 7.4 to 7.3**) is **not** advised. It can cause dependency hell or system instability.
    

### 🔄 **4\. Understanding Major vs Minor Upgrades**

| Upgrade Type | Example | Tool Used | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Major | RHEL 7 → RHEL 8 | Not with yum | Requires clean install or Leapp tool |
| Minor | RHEL 7.3 → 7.4 | `yum update` | Safe and common with proper repo setup |

### 🔍 **5\.** `yum update` vs `yum upgrade`

| Command | Preserves Configs | Removes Obsolete Packages | Safe for Production |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `yum update` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| `yum upgrade` | ❌ May replace/remove | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Use with caution |

#### 🧪 Example:

```bash
sudo yum update     # Updates all packages, keeps obsolete configs
sudo yum upgrade    # May remove deprecated or unused packages
```

### 🏠 **6\. Setting Up a Local Repository**

In disconnected or secure environments, you may need a **local repo** for package installation.

#### ✅ Commands:

```bash
# 1. Create directory
mkdir -p /repo/local

# 2. Copy RPMs
cp *.rpm /repo/local/

# 3. Create repo metadata
createrepo /repo/local

# 4. Add a new repo file
cat <<EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo
[local]
name=Local Repo
baseurl=file:///repo/local
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF

# 5. Clean and refresh
yum clean all
yum repolist
```

#### 💡 Use Case:

* Setting up isolated RHEL/CentOS systems in data centers without internet access.
    

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Summary

| Problem | Possible Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Cannot find package` | Repo not enabled or missing | Check `yum repolist`, fix `.repo` file |
| `yum history undo` fails | Old metadata or package removed from repo | Try manual downgrade or reinstallation |
| System unstable after upgrade | Major version conflict or missing dependencies | Restore from snapshot or rescue boot |
| Configs overwritten | Used `upgrade` instead of `update` | Use backups, or restore from `/etc` copies |

### **✅ Summary of Best Practices**

✔️ Always check `yum history` after updates  
✔️ Snapshot VMs before major operations  
✔️ Use `yum update` in production environments  
✔️ Create local repositories for air-gapped systems  
✔️ Avoid downgrading system versions unless critical  
✔️ Use `rpm -qc` to locate and protect config files before upgrades

## 🛰️ File Transfer Utilities

## 📁 Section A: `wget`, `curl`, and `ping` – The Basics of File Download and Connectivity Testing

### 🌐 1. `wget` – Command-Line File Downloader

`wget` is a non-interactive utility used for downloading files from the web via HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP. It is especially useful on servers without a graphical interface.

#### 📌 Why use `wget`?

Most Linux servers in production environments **do not have browsers or GUI**, so `wget` is an essential tool to fetch files from URLs.

#### 🧪 Syntax:

```bash
wget [options] <URL>
```

#### 🧪 Examples:

```bash
# Download a file from a web URL
wget http://example.com/sample.txt

# Download and save it with a different name
wget -O mytext.txt http://example.com/sample.txt

# Resume a partially downloaded file
wget -c http://example.com/largefile.iso
```

#### 📍 Real-World Use Case:

You're setting up an internal software repo and need to download a tarball:

```bash
wget https://downloads.apache.org/httpd/httpd-2.4.59.tar.gz
```

#### 🛠️ Troubleshooting:

* **"command not found"**: Install it via `yum install wget` or `dnf install wget`
    
* **Permission denied**: Run `wget` with `sudo` or change destination directory.
    

### 🌐 2. `curl` – Flexible Data Transfer Tool

`curl` can download and upload files using various protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SCP, SFTP, and more. It’s more feature-rich and scriptable than `wget`.

#### 🧪 Syntax:

```bash
curl [options] <URL>
```

#### 🧪 Examples:

```bash
# Download a file
curl http://example.com/file.txt

# Save the file with the same name as on the server
curl -O http://example.com/file.txt

# Save with a custom name
curl -o custom_name.txt http://example.com/file.txt
```

#### 📍 Real-World Use Case:

Use `curl` in scripts to check API health:

```bash
curl -I https://mywebsite.com/api/health
```

#### 🛠️ Troubleshooting:

* If `curl` is not installed:
    

```bash
sudo yum install curl   # RHEL/CentOS 7 and earlier
sudo dnf install curl   # RHEL/CentOS 8 and later
```

* Use `-k` if you're dealing with insecure HTTPS for testing (not recommended for production).
    

### 🌐 3. `ping` – Network Connectivity Checker

`ping` is used to check whether a host is reachable and how long packets take to travel to it.

#### 🧪 Syntax:

```bash
ping [hostname or IP]
```

#### 🧪 Examples:

```bash
# Check if Google is reachable
ping www.google.com

# Ping an IP address
ping 8.8.8.8

# Limit to 4 packets
ping -c 4 www.google.com
```

#### 📍 Real-World Use Case:

You're troubleshooting DNS or firewall issues and want to verify if your server can reach external websites:

```bash
ping -c 3 google.com
```

#### 🛠️ Troubleshooting:

* **No response?**
    
    * Check firewall rules.
        
    * Try `ping` with IP to test DNS.
        
    * Use `traceroute` if the issue persists.
        

### 📌 Summary

| Tool | Purpose | Use Case Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wget | Download file (simple) | `wget http://...` |
| curl | Download/upload + scripting | `curl -O http://...` |
| ping | Check network connectivity | `ping` [`www.google.com`](http://www.google.com) |

## 📁 FTP – File Transfer Protocol Setup and Usage

### 📌 What is FTP?

**FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server over a TCP/IP network. It uses a **client-server model** and operates on two channels:

* **Control Channel (Port 21)** – for commands
    
* **Data Channel (Port 20 or passive port range)** – for actual file transfer
    

### 🧠 Why FTP in Linux?

In environments where:

* GUI or browser is not available
    
* Secure FTP/SCP is not required
    
* Compatibility with legacy systems is needed  
    FTP still remains a viable option.
    

### 🛠️ FTP Setup – Linux-to-Linux

Let’s simulate this using:

* **Server**: `my-ansible` (acts as FTP server)
    
* **Client**: `my-node1` (acts as FTP client)
    

### 📌 Step-by-Step: FTP Server Setup on `my-ansible`

### 1\. 🧪 Check if FTP server is already installed

```bash
rpm -qa | grep vsftpd
```

### 2\. 🧰 Install `vsftpd`

```bash
sudo yum install vsftpd -y     # RHEL/CentOS 7 and earlier
sudo dnf install vsftpd -y     # RHEL/CentOS 8/9
```

### 3\. ✍️ Configure the FTP server

Make a backup and edit the config file:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf.bak
sudo vi /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
```

Modify the following lines:

```ini
anonymous_enable=NO
ascii_upload_enable=YES
ascii_download_enable=YES
ftpd_banner=Welcome to IPL FTP Service.
use_localtime=YES
```

> Tip: Uncomment the above lines if they’re commented with `#`.

### 4\. 🔥 Disable Firewalld (lab/testing only)

```bash
sudo systemctl stop firewalld
sudo systemctl disable firewalld
```

For real environments, open only port 21:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=21/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### 5\. 🔁 Start and enable FTP service

```bash
sudo systemctl start vsftpd
sudo systemctl enable vsftpd
```

### 6\. 👤 Create user for FTP access

```bash
sudo useradd revanth
sudo passwd revanth
```

## 🚀 FTP Client Setup on `my-node1`

### 1\. 🔧 Install FTP client

```bash
sudo yum install ftp -y
```

### 2\. 🧪 Create a sample file to upload

```bash
su - revanth
touch ramesh
```

## 🔁 Transfer File from Client to Server

### Connect to FTP server:

```bash
ftp 192.168.1.x
```

Enter username `revanth` and the password.

### Inside FTP prompt:

```bash
bi          # Switch to binary mode
hash        # Show progress hash marks
put ramesh  # Upload the file
bye         # Exit FTP session
```

## 🧠 Real-World Use Case:

An internal test lab doesn’t allow SCP/SSH but FTP is allowed. Using this setup, you can:

* Transfer test files
    
* Distribute internal scripts or documents
    
* Share software packages for isolated environments
    

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips:

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| `ftp: command not found` | Install FTP client using `yum install ftp` |
| Cannot connect to FTP server | Check if `vsftpd` is running, verify port 21 is open |
| Login fails | Ensure user exists and has shell access, check `/etc/ftpusers` |
| Passive mode errors | Enable passive mode and open passive port range in firewall |
| No file upload | Check file/directory permissions for the FTP user's home directory |

## 🔐 SCP – Secure File Transfer in Linux

## 📌 What is SCP?

**SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)** allows you to securely transfer files between Linux systems over an **SSH (Secure Shell)** connection. It uses **port 22**, just like SSH, and encrypts the data during transfer.

### 🧠 Why Use SCP?

* More secure than FTP
    
* Easy to use with no extra setup (uses existing SSH)
    
* Ideal for remote administration, backups, and automation
    

## 🖥️ Lab Setup

Let’s continue with our previous setup:

* **Client**: `my-node1`
    
* **Server**: `my-ansible`
    
* **User**: `revanth` on both machines
    

## 📌 SCP File Transfer – Syntax

```bash
scp [options] source_file username@destination:/path/to/destination
```

## 🧪 Example 1: Local to Remote File Transfer

On `my-node1`:

```bash
touch durga
scp durga revanth@192.168.1.x:/home/revanth
```

### 💬 You’ll be prompted:

```bash
The authenticity of host '192.168.1.x' can't be established.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
```

Enter the password when prompted.

✅ File will be copied securely to `/home/revanth` on `my-ansible`.

## 🧪 Example 2: Remote to Local File Transfer

On `my-node1`:

```bash
scp revanth@192.168.1.x:/home/revanth/durga /tmp/
```

✅ File will be securely downloaded to `/tmp/` on the local system.

## 🧪 Example 3: Copy Directory Recursively

```bash
scp -r myproject revanth@192.168.1.x:/home/revanth/
```

✅ This will copy the entire `myproject` directory from client to server.

## 🧠 Real-World Use Cases:

| Use Case | Example Command |
| --- | --- |
| Securely transfer a backup file | `scp backup.tar revanth@192.168.1.x:/backups/` |
| Pull logs from a remote machine | `scp revanth@192.168.1.x:/var/log/httpd/error_log ./` |
| Transfer config between servers | `scp -r /etc/nginx revanth@192.168.1.x:/tmp/nginx_backup` |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips:

| Problem | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| `scp: command not found` | Install OpenSSH client: `sudo yum install openssh-clients -y` |
| Permission denied | Ensure user and path are correct, check file permissions |
| Host key verification failed | Remove stale entry from `~/.ssh/known_hosts` |
| Connection timed out | Check if SSH is enabled and firewall allows port 22 |
| File not transferred fully | Use `-C` for compression or `-v` for verbose debug mode |

## 🛡️ Best Practices

* Use **SSH keys** instead of passwords for automation and enhanced security
    
* Avoid root transfers unless absolutely necessary
    
* Use `rsync` for large or incremental backups (covered next)
    

## 🔄 `rsync` – Fast and Reliable File Synchronization

## 📌 What is `rsync`?

`rsync` (Remote Sync) is a file transfer utility designed for **fast, incremental, and efficient data synchronization**. It’s used to copy or synchronize files:

* Locally within the same system
    
* Between systems over SSH
    
* For regular backups or mirroring
    

## ✅ Why Use `rsync`?

* Transfers **only the changes** (delta sync)
    
* Supports **compression** during transfer
    
* Can **resume interrupted transfers**
    
* Faster than `scp` and `ftp` for repeated or large data syncs
    

## ⚙️ Installation

Before using, ensure `rsync` is installed:

### 🔸 On RHEL/CentOS:

```bash
sudo yum install rsync -y
```

### 🔸 On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get install rsync -y
```

## 🧪 Use Case 1: Local File Backup

Let’s say we want to back up everything in `/home/revanth` to `/tmp/backups/`.

```bash
rsync -avzh /home/revanth/ /tmp/backups/
```

### 🔍 Flags used:

* `-a` = archive mode (preserves permissions, timestamps, symbolic links, etc.)
    
* `-v` = verbose
    
* `-z` = compress data during transfer
    
* `-h` = human-readable numbers
    

## 🧪 Use Case 2: Transfer File to Remote Machine

```bash
rsync -avz backup.tar revanth@192.168.1.x:/tmp/backups/
```

✅ Copies `backup.tar` to remote machine `192.168.1.x` into `/tmp/backups`.

## 🧪 Use Case 3: Sync Directory to Remote Machine

```bash
rsync -avz /home/revanth/ revanth@192.168.1.x:/tmp/backups/
```

✅ Synchronizes entire `/home/revanth/` folder to remote `/tmp/backups/`.

## 🧪 Use Case 4: Pull File From Remote to Local

```bash
rsync -avz revanth@192.168.1.x:/home/revanth/myfile /tmp/backups/
```

✅ Pulls `myfile` from the remote server to local `/tmp/backups`.

## 🧠 Real-World Examples

| Scenario | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Mirror a web directory | `rsync -avz /var/www/ /mnt/backup/www/` |
| Backup cron job to remote host | `rsync -az /etc/ revanth@192.168.1.x:/backup/etc/` |
| Sync log files from production server | `rsync -avzh root@prod-server:/var/log/ /central-logs/` |
| Schedule daily sync via `cron` | `0 2 * * * rsync -az /home/data /mnt/nfs/backup/` |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips

| Problem | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| `rsync: command not found` | Install rsync with `yum install rsync -y` or `apt-get install rsync` |
| Permission denied | Verify user, permissions, and SSH access |
| Partial transfer | Use `--partial` and `--progress` options |
| Exclude files from syncing | Use `--exclude '*.log'` to skip `.log` files |
| Preserve hard links | Add `-H` to keep hard links intact |

## 🔐 Bonus Tips

* Add `-e ssh` explicitly if SSH is not the default:
    
    ```bash
    rsync -avze ssh /data revanth@192.168.1.x:/backup/
    ```
    
* To delete destination files not in source (for mirror backups):
    
    ```bash
    rsync -avz --delete /source/ /dest/
    ```
    

## 🔁 SCP vs `rsync`

| Feature | SCP | `rsync` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Encryption | Yes (SSH) | Yes (SSH) |
| Compression | Manual | Built-in (`-z`) |
| Sync feature | No | Yes (only sync changes) |
| Resume support | No | Yes |
| Speed | Slower for large or repeated data | Faster due to delta transfer |

## ✅ **Conclusion – Advanced Package & File Transfer Utilities**

In this chapter, you took a deep dive into some of the most crucial tools for real-world Linux system administration—ranging from package management to file transfer utilities.

We covered:
