## Process Control, Job Management & Scheduling in Linux

Linux gives you powerful tools to inspect, manage, and automate tasks via processes and scheduled jobs. This section covers the most commonly used commands every SysAdmin or DevOps engineer should know.

### 🧠 `systemctl` – Control the Systemd System and Services

**Description:**  
Used to manage services (start, stop, enable, disable) and control system states.

**Syntax:**

```bash
systemctl status nginx         # Check service status
sudo systemctl start nginx     # Start a service

sudo systemctl restart nginx   # Restart a service
sudo systemctl enable nginx    # Enable on boot
```

**Real Use Case:**

* Start your web server or database
    
* Check failed service logs using `journalctl`
    

### 👓 `ps` – Display Running Processes

**Description:**  
Shows current processes on the system.

**Syntax:**

```bash
ps            # Current shell processes
ps aux        # All processes (user + system)
ps -ef        # Full-format listing
```

**Example:**

```bash
ps aux | grep apache
```

**Real Use Case:**

* Troubleshooting performance or zombie processes
    
* Checking memory/CPU consumption per process
    

### 📊 `top` – Dynamic Real-Time Process Monitor

**Description:**  
Interactive tool to monitor running processes and system resource usage.

**Syntax:**

```bash
top
```

**Useful Keys:**

* `q` = Quit
    
* `k` = Kill a process
    
* `r` = Renice a process
    

**Real Use Case:**

* Monitor live CPU, memory, and process stats
    
* Useful in high-load servers
    

### ☠️ `kill` & `pkill` – Terminate Processes

**kill** – Sends signals to process IDs.

**pkill** – Kills process by name.

**Syntax:**

```bash
kill -9 PID          # Force kill a process
pkill nginx          # Kill all nginx processes
```

**Real Use Case:**

* Gracefully or forcefully end stuck or rogue processes
    

### 🕒 `crontab` – Automate Recurring Tasks

**Description:**  
Schedule jobs (cronjobs) that run at regular intervals.

**Syntax:**

```bash
crontab -e         # Edit user’s cron table
crontab -l         # List cronjobs
```

**Format:**

```bash
* * * * * command_to_run
# ┬ ┬ ┬ ┬ ┬
# │ │ │ │ │
# │ │ │ │ └─ Day of week (0-7)
# │ │ │ └─── Month (1-12)
# │ │ └───── Day (1-31)
# │ └─────── Hour (0-23)
# └───────── Minute (0-59)
```

**Example:**

```bash
0 5 * * * /home/revanth/backup.sh    # Daily 5 AM backup
```

## 📦 Additional Cronjobs – How They Work (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)

Linux has a built-in job scheduler called `cron`, and apart from user-defined `crontab`, it also runs scheduled jobs from **standard system directories**.

These are typically used by **system services**, package updates, backups, logs, etc.

### 🗂️ Default Cron Job Directories:

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/cron.hourly/` | Scripts run **every hour** |
| `/etc/cron.daily/` | Scripts run **once per day** |
| `/etc/cron.weekly/` | Scripts run **once per week** |
| `/etc/cron.monthly/` | Scripts run **once per month** |

### 🧠 How It Works Behind the Scenes

* The `crontab` file for root (`/etc/crontab`) is configured to call the `run-parts` script:
    

```bash
# /etc/crontab (sample)
01 *    * * *   root    run-parts /etc/cron.hourly
02 4    * * *   root    run-parts /etc/cron.daily
22 4    * * 0   root    run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
42 4    1 * *   root    run-parts /etc/cron.monthly
```

* The `run-parts` command **runs all executable scripts** found inside the specified directory.
    

So, for example, **at 4:02 AM every day**, all scripts inside `/etc/cron.daily/` are executed **in sequence**.

### ✅ Usage Instructions:

To schedule a script:

1. Write a shell script ([`backup.sh`](http://backup.sh), `cleanup_`[`logs.sh`](http://logs.sh), etc.)
    
2. Make it executable:
    
    ```bash
    chmod +x your_script.sh
    ```
    
3. Move it to the appropriate directory:
    
    ```bash
    sudo mv your_script.sh /etc/cron.daily/
    ```
    

### 💡 Real-Time Use Cases

| Use Case | Directory | Example Script |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 💾 Daily DB or File Backups | `/etc/cron.daily/` | `/etc/cron.daily/db_`[`backup.sh`](http://backup.sh) |
| 🧹 Log File Cleanup | `/etc/cron.weekly/` | Remove logs older than 7 days |
| 🔄 Cache Purging | `/etc/cron.hourly/` | Clear cache hourly for high-traffic apps |
| 📊 Monthly Audit Reports | `/etc/cron.monthly/` | Email disk usage reports to admin |
| 🔐 Auto Security Updates | `/etc/cron.daily/` | Run `yum update` or `apt update` daily |
| 🧪 Rotate or compress logs | `/etc/cron.weekly/` | Use `logrotate` configs |

### 🛑 Important Notes:

* Scripts must be **simple shell scripts**, and ideally without extensions (`.sh` is okay but not necessary).
    
* Avoid scripts that require **interactive input**, unless explicitly handled.
    
* Make sure **permissions** and **ownership** are correct:
    
    ```bash
    chown root:root /etc/cron.daily/your_script
    chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/your_script
    ```
    

### 🔍 To Debug or Check Output:

Cron logs are typically recorded in:

```bash
/var/log/cron
```

Or you can redirect output in your script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cleanup.sh
rm -rf /tmp/* > /var/log/cleanup.log 2>&1
```

Let’s create **two sample scripts** you can directly use with the additional cronjob directories:

## 🧹 1. **Log Cleanup Script (Weekly)**

Place this in `/etc/cron.weekly/`  
It deletes logs older than **7 days** from `/var/log/myapp/`.

### 🔧 Script: `log_`[`cleanup.sh`](http://cleanup.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Cleanup logs older than 7 days

LOG_DIR="/var/log/myapp"
DAYS_OLD=7

echo "[INFO] Cleaning logs older than $DAYS_OLD days from $LOG_DIR"
find "$LOG_DIR" -type f -name "*.log" -mtime +$DAYS_OLD -exec rm -f {} \;

echo "[DONE] Old logs deleted on $(date)" >> /var/log/log_cleanup_report.log
```

### ✅ Setup Steps:

```bash
sudo chmod +x log_cleanup.sh
sudo mv log_cleanup.sh /etc/cron.weekly/
```

## 💾 2. **Daily Backup Script (Daily)**

Place this in `/etc/cron.daily/`  
It creates a compressed backup of `/home/projects` into `/backup` folder.

### 🔧 Script: `daily_`[`backup.sh`](http://backup.sh)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily backup of /home/projects directory

SOURCE="/home/projects"
DESTINATION="/backup"
DATE=$(date +%F)
BACKUP_FILE="$DESTINATION/projects_backup_$DATE.tar.gz"

# Create backup folder if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$DESTINATION"

# Archive and compress
tar -czf "$BACKUP_FILE" "$SOURCE"

echo "[INFO] Backup created: $BACKUP_FILE" >> /var/log/daily_backup.log
```

### ✅ Setup Steps:

```bash
sudo chmod +x daily_backup.sh
sudo mv daily_backup.sh /etc/cron.daily/
```

### 📌 Pro Tips:

* Use `du -sh /backup` to check space usage.
    
* Add email alerts or push notifications for backup failures later.
    
* You can exclude large or temp files using `--exclude` in `tar`.
    

If you just want file-level backup and log cleanup, then the two cron-based scripts above are perfect starters. They’re lightweight, simple, and align with real-world practices for:

🧹 **Log Cleanup (weekly):** Prevents `/var/log` or app logs from bloating your server  
💾 **File Backups (daily):** Regular backup of project folders for safety and disaster recovery

If you want to later extend this for:

* Monthly archive rotation
    
* Remote backups with `rsync`
    
* Notification on success/failure
    
* Or cleanup of older backups themselves
    

### ⏰ `at` – Run a Command Once at a Specific Time

**Description:**  
Schedules a one-time command at a future time.

**Syntax:**

```bash
at 17:00
at> echo "Hello from the future" >> /tmp/message.txt
at> <Ctrl+D>
```

**Real Use Case:**

* Delay execution of critical scripts
    
* Schedule reboots or alerts after business hours
    

### 🔄 `bg`, `fg`, and `nohup` – Managing Background & Foreground Jobs Like a Pro

These commands are all about job control in the shell — extremely useful when you're multitasking or running long processes.

### 🧠 Why They Matter in Real-Time:

Let’s say you start a long-running process — maybe a file transfer, a backup script, or a build job — and then realize:

* You forgot to run it in the background
    
* You want to do something else in the same terminal
    
* Or worse, your terminal might disconnect (like in SSH), killing the job 😬
    

That’s where these tools come in clutch.

### 🔧 `bg` – Run a Stopped Job in the Background

```bash
sleep 60
# Press Ctrl + Z → this stops the job
bg
# This resumes it in the background
```

✅ Real use: Temporarily stop any command and send it to background if you need to work on something else.

### 🔧 `fg` – Bring a Background Job to Foreground

```bash
fg
# Brings the last background job to foreground
```

If you have multiple jobs, list them first using:

```bash
jobs
fg %2   # Brings job number 2 to foreground
```

### 🔒 `nohup` – Make Jobs Immune to Hangups (Disconnections)

Say you’re SSH’d into a server and want to run a script that lasts hours. If you close the terminal, it dies — unless you use `nohup`.

```bash
nohup ./long-running-script.sh &
```

* `nohup` = "no hangup"
    
* `&` = run in background
    
* Output goes to `nohup.out` by default
    

✅ Real use: Keeping scripts running even if the terminal dies or disconnects.

### 🛠️ Pro Combo Use Case:

```bash
nohup rsync -av /data /backup &
```

🔥 Use this when:

* Backing up large directories
    
* Downloading large files
    
* Running app/server start scripts
    

### 🎚️ `nice` & `renice` – Controlling Process Priority in Linux

In Linux, every process has a **priority level** that determines how much CPU time it gets. The kernel uses this priority (called the **"nice value"**) to schedule tasks.

💡 *More “nice” = lower priority. Less “nice” = higher priority.*

### 📊 What Is "Nice Value"?

* Ranges from **\-20 (highest priority)** to **19 (lowest priority)**
    
* Default is **0**
    
* Only root can set **negative nice values**
    

### 🔧 `nice` – Start a New Process with Priority

```bash
nice -n 10 ./myscript.sh
```

➡️ Starts [`myscript.sh`](http://myscript.sh) with a **nice value of 10** (lower priority)

✅ Real use: Run CPU-heavy background tasks without slowing down important processes.

### 🔧 `renice` – Change Priority of a Running Process

```bash
renice -n 5 -p 1234
```

➡️ Changes the priority of PID 1234 to **nice value 5**

👑 Root privilege needed for lowering priority (e.g., going from 10 to -5)

### 🧠 Real-World Use Cases

| Scenario | Use |
| --- | --- |
| 🧪 Running a script that consumes high CPU | Use `nice` to lower priority |
| 🛠️ Adjusting priority of a background build job | Use `renice` dynamically |
| ⚙️ Database process is lagging due to background tasks | `renice` other tasks or raise DB priority |

### 📌 Example:

```bash
ps -eo pid,ni,cmd --sort=ni
# View processes with their nice value

sudo renice -n -5 -p 1023
# Boost priority of process 1023 (e.g., database or server)
```

## 📁 `df` – **Disk Space Usage**

`df` stands for **Disk Filesystem**. It tells you how much **disk space is used and available** on mounted filesystems.

### 📌 Syntax:

```bash
df [options]
```

### ✅ Common Options:

* `-h` → Human-readable format (MB, GB)
    
* `-T` → Show filesystem type (ext4, xfs, etc.)
    
* `-x` → Exclude specific types
    
* `--total` → Show total of all filesystems
    

### 🔍 Examples:

```bash
df -h
```

> Displays disk usage in human-readable format (GB/MB)

```bash
df -hT
```

> Adds filesystem types to your output

### 🛠️ Real Use Case:

* Monitor root (`/`) partition to avoid "disk full" issues
    
* Check space before expanding storage or installing software
    
* Useful in backup scripts to validate available space
    

## 🧠 `free` – **RAM & Swap Memory Status**

This command gives a **quick snapshot** of memory usage, including RAM and swap.

### 📌 Syntax:

```bash
free [options]
```

### ✅ Common Options:

* `-h` → Human-readable (MB/GB)
    
* `-m` → Show in MB
    
* `-g` → Show in GB
    
* `-t` → Show total summary
    

### 🔍 Example:

```bash
free -h
```

> Quickly shows used, free, and available memory in GB/MB

### 🛠️ Real Use Case:

* Check if system is **using swap** — indicates RAM stress
    
* Track memory leaks in apps or services
    
* Determine if RAM upgrade is needed
    

## 📊 `top` – **Live System Resource Monitor**

This is like Task Manager in Linux. It shows a **real-time, dynamic view** of CPU, memory, and process usage.

### 📌 Command:

```bash
top
```

### 🔍 Key Fields to Watch:

* `%CPU`, `%MEM` → See which processes are resource hogs
    
* `PID` → Process ID
    
* `TIME+` → Total CPU time
    
* `RES` → Resident memory usage (RAM)
    

### 🎯 Real Use Cases:

* Identify **high CPU/memory consuming** processes
    
* Sort and kill stuck or zombie processes
    
* Monitor system health in real time
    

### 🔧 Pro Tips:

* Press `M` inside `top` → Sort by memory
    
* Press `P` → Sort by CPU
    
* Press `k` → Enter PID to kill a process
    
* Use `htop` (if available) for a colorized, more interactive version
    

### 📈 `iostat` – Disk I/O and CPU Performance Monitoring

`iostat` stands for **Input/Output Statistics**. It helps you **analyze the load** on your system’s disks and CPU, which is super useful when you're troubleshooting **performance bottlenecks**, especially related to **disk I/O**.

### 📦 Where Does `iostat` Come From?

`iostat` is part of the `sysstat` package.

#### ✅ Install it first (if not already):

```bash
# On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
sudo yum install sysstat

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install sysstat
```

### 🛠️ Basic Syntax

```bash
iostat [options] [interval] [count]
```

* **interval**: how often to refresh output (in seconds)
    
* **count**: number of reports to generate
    

### 🔍 Common Usage Examples

#### 1️⃣ Get Basic CPU + Device I/O stats (one-time report)

```bash
iostat
```

#### 2️⃣ Watch live system performance every 2 seconds (until interrupted)

```bash
iostat -xz 2
```

* `-x`: Extended I/O stats (detailed)
    
* `-z`: Don't show devices with 0 activity
    

### 📊 Output Breakdown (important fields)

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **%user** | CPU time spent in user space |
| **%iowait** | Time CPU is waiting for I/O (higher = bad) |
| **tps** | Transfers per second (read/write ops) |
| **kB\_read/s** | KB read per second |
| **kB\_wrtn/s** | KB written per second |
| **await** | Avg wait time for I/O requests |
| **%util** | Disk utilization – above 80% = 🔥 bottleneck |

### ⚠️ When to Use `iostat`?

✅ Real-Time Troubleshooting Use Cases:

| Use Case | `iostat` Helps You... |
| --- | --- |
| 🐌 App is slow but CPU usage is low | Check if high `%iowait` or disk `%util` |
| 📉 DB performance drops randomly | Spot if specific disks are overloaded |
| 💾 Heavy read/write workloads | Measure disk throughput (read/write per sec) |
| 🔍 Identifying failing or slow disks | Look for abnormal `await` or `%util` |

### 🧪 Example for Monitoring:

```bash
iostat -xd 5 3
```

* Gives 3 reports at 5-second intervals
    
* `-x`: extended output
    
* `-d`: device report only
    

### 🧯 Pro Tips

* **High** `%iowait` → Your disk is a bottleneck
    
* `await` &gt; 20ms consistently → Could mean slow disk or contention
    
* Combine `iostat` with `top`, `vmstat`, or `iotop` for deeper analysis
    
* Useful for tuning DB servers, NFS storage, and virtual machines
