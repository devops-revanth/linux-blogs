## 🔐 Password Aging Policies in Linux

In a secure multi-user Linux environment, **password aging** is crucial. It allows system admins to enforce password expiry, minimum days between password changes, and warn users before their passwords expire.

This is not just about security — in real-world environments, especially in **DevOps and server management**, companies enforce these policies as part of compliance (like PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, etc.).

### 🔍 Why Use Password Aging?

* Prevents users from keeping the same password forever
    
* Enforces regular password updates
    
* Enhances system security
    
* Helps meet organizational compliance standards
    

### 🧪 View User’s Password Aging Information

```bash
sudo chage -l username
```

#### 📘 Example:

```bash
sudo chage -l viratkohli
```

**Output:**

```bash
Last password change                                    : Apr 16, 2025
Password expires                                        : May 16, 2025
Password inactive                                       : never
Account expires                                         : never
Minimum number of days between password change          : 0
Maximum number of days between password change          : 30
Number of days of warning before password expires       : 7
```

This tells us when the user last changed their password, when it will expire, and when they’ll get a warning.

### 🛠️ Setting Password Expiry Policies

Use the `chage` command to set password aging options.

```bash
sudo chage [options] username
```

#### Common Options:

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `-M` | Set **maximum** number of days a password is valid |
| `-m` | Set **minimum** number of days before a password can be changed |
| `-W` | Set number of days **before expiry** to warn the user |
| `-I` | Set number of days **after expiry** until account is disabled |
| `-E` | Set **account expiry date** (in YYYY-MM-DD format) |

### 🔨 Examples

#### 🔹 Set Password to Expire Every 45 Days:

```bash
sudo chage -M 45 viratkohli
```

#### 🔹 Set Minimum 7 Days Between Password Changes:

```bash
sudo chage -m 7 viratkohli
```

#### 🔹 Warn User 5 Days Before Password Expiry:

```bash
sudo chage -W 5 viratkohli
```

#### 🔹 Expire Password Immediately (Force Change on Next Login):

```bash
sudo chage -d 0 viratkohli
```

🔁 Use this when you’ve just created a user and want them to change their password on first login.

### 🧯 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Password not expiring | `-M` value not set | Use `chage -M <days>` |
| User still logs in with expired password | Inactivity not configured | Set with `-I` |
| User not warned before expiry | Forgot `-W` | Set with `chage -W` |

## 📁 Understanding `/etc/login.defs`: The Hidden File That Governs User Defaults

Whenever you create a new user using `useradd`, the system doesn't just randomly assign settings — it uses **default values**, and most of those are defined in `/etc/login.defs`.

This file is like the *governing constitution* for user creation defaults in Linux.

### 🔍 What is `/etc/login.defs`?

`/etc/login.defs` contains configuration settings that define how user accounts are managed — from UID ranges to password aging policies and home directory creation.

When you run:

```bash
sudo useradd devplayer
```

… the values for password aging, UID ranges, etc., come from **here** unless overridden with command-line options or modified by admin scripts.

### 🔎 Key Fields in `/etc/login.defs`

| Directive | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `PASS_MAX_DAYS` | Maximum days before password expiry |
| `PASS_MIN_DAYS` | Minimum days between password changes |
| `PASS_WARN_AGE` | Days before expiry to warn user |
| `UID_MIN` | Starting UID for normal users |
| `UID_MAX` | Maximum UID for normal users |
| `CREATE_HOME` | Whether to create a home directory by default |

### 📘 Example Configuration

```bash
PASS_MAX_DAYS   90
PASS_MIN_DAYS   7
PASS_WARN_AGE   7
UID_MIN         1000
UID_MAX         60000
CREATE_HOME     yes
```

This config means:

* User passwords will expire after 90 days
    
* Users must wait 7 days before changing passwords
    
* They’ll get a 7-day warning before password expiry
    
* UIDs for normal users will start from 1000
    
* Home directories will be created by default
    

### 🛠 Real-World Tip

🔧 If you work in a production environment where compliance is strict (like banks or health systems), **editing this file ensures every new user you create meets the company policy automatically**.

You don’t have to manually apply `chage` every time — just set these rules once here!

### 🧯 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Reason | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New users not getting a home directory | `CREATE_HOME` is set to `no` | Change it to `yes` and re-create the user or use `-m` flag |
| Password policies not applying | Overridden by `useradd` flags or chage | Double-check with `chage -l username` |
| UID overlaps with system users | `UID_MIN` set too low | Update to 1000+ |

## 👥 Switching Users in Linux: `su` vs `sudo` – When & Why to Use Each

In a multi-user Linux system, you won't (and shouldn’t) always operate as root. Instead, you'll *switch users* based on the task at hand. That’s where `su` and `sudo` come into play — and both serve different purposes with different implications for security.

Let’s clear the air on these two ✨

### 🧠 `su` – Substitute User (Mostly Used for Root Access)

* **su** allows you to **switch to another user**, usually root.
    
* Requires the **target user's password**.
    
* When you type `su` alone, it switches to **root**.
    

### 🔍 Syntax & Examples:

```bash
su         # Switch to root user (requires root password)
su -       # Also loads root's environment
su - john  # Switch to user 'john' and load their environment
```

### 🧪 Real-World Example:

```bash
su -
Password: ********
```

You’re now root. You can confirm using:

```bash
whoami
```

Output:

```bash
root
```

### ✅ Use `su` When:

* You **know the root password**
    
* You need **long root sessions**
    
* Sudo isn’t configured or allowed
    

### ⚠️ Drawbacks of `su`

* Requires sharing the **root password** (not safe on shared teams)
    
* Leaves an open root shell if not exited
    
* No command logging
    

## 🔐 `sudo` – Superuser Do (The Safer Alternative)

* `sudo` lets a **regular user run specific commands with root privileges**.
    
* Doesn’t require the root password — instead uses **your own**.
    
* It’s more secure, configurable, and logs every command.
    

### 🔍 Syntax & Examples:

```bash
sudo command            # Run one command with root privileges
sudo -i                 # Get an interactive root shell
sudo su -               # Switch to root (via sudo)
```

Example:

```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

Prompts for **your own password**, not root’s.

### 💼 Real-World Use Case

Your team has multiple DevOps engineers. Instead of sharing the root password (bad practice), each engineer is added to the **sudo group**, and only specific commands are allowed via `/etc/sudoers`.

### 🛠 Configure Sudo Access

To add a user to the `sudo` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo username
```

Verify with:

```bash
groups username
```

### 📄 View Sudo Logs

To see what commands were run via sudo:

```bash
cat /var/log/auth.log | grep sudo
```

or on some systems:

```bash
journalctl | grep sudo
```

### 🧯 Troubleshooting: su vs sudo

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sudo: user is not in the sudoers file` | User not in sudo group | Add with `usermod -aG sudo user` |
| `su: Authentication failure` | Wrong root password | Use `sudo` or reset root password |
| `sudo: command not found` | `sudo` package not installed | Install it via `apt install sudo` or `yum install sudo` |

### 🎯 Pro Tip

💡 Use `sudo` over `su` for **better control, security, and audit**. Many cloud systems like AWS or GCP even **disable root login entirely** and only allow `sudo`.

## 🔐 `sudo` – Superpower with Safety

Rey kanna, `sudo` antey *Superuser Do* — it allows permitted users to **run commands with elevated (root) privileges** temporarily, **without switching to the root account** permanently. It’s like giving someone a spare key to your house, but with limited access and logging enabled. 🔑📜

### 🔧 Why Use `sudo` Instead of `su` or Root Login?

| Feature | `sudo` | `su` / `login as root` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Logged command history | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Granular permissions | ✅ Yes (`/etc/sudoers`) | ❌ No |
| User accountability | ✅ Yes (logs who did what) | ❌ No |
| Session timeout | ✅ Yes (default: 5 mins) | ❌ No (until logout) |
| Multi-user safety | ✅ Ideal for shared environments | ❌ Risky — full access |

### 🛠️ Syntax and Usage

```bash
sudo <command>
```

📌 **Examples:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

### 🧾 `sudoers` File & `visudo`

The power of `sudo` comes from the `/etc/sudoers` file. It controls **who can do what**.

🛡️ Always edit it using:

```bash
sudo visudo
```

This prevents syntax errors that could **lock you out of sudo!**

### 🧑‍💼 Granting Sudo Access to a User

Let’s say you created a new user `viratkohli`, and now want him to use `sudo`:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo viratkohli
```

👉 This adds the user to the `sudo` group (on Ubuntu/Debian). On RHEL/CentOS, you may need to add to the `wheel` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG wheel viratkohli
```

🧠 **Pro Tip:** Log out and log back in after adding to the sudo group for changes to take effect.

### 🔒 Limiting sudo Privileges

Let’s say you want `rishabpant` to only restart Apache and nothing else:

```bash
sudo visudo
```

Add:

```bash
rishabpant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart apache2
```

Boom 💥 — he can only restart Apache, and won’t be asked for a password.

### 📜 Where is sudo activity logged?

Sudo actions are logged into:

```bash
/var/log/auth.log     # Ubuntu/Debian
/var/log/secure       # RHEL/CentOS
```

You can check history:

```bash
sudo grep 'sudo' /var/log/auth.log
```

This is 🔐 critical in production — every action is traceable!

### ⚠️ Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `user is not in the sudoers file` | User lacks sudo rights | Add user to `sudo` or `wheel` group |
| `sudo: command not found` | Minimal OS install or path issue | Install sudo: `apt install sudo` or `yum install sudo` |
| `Permission denied` after sudo | Wrong syntax or command path | Use full path or correct syntax |

### ✅ Best Practices for Using `sudo`

* Never give full sudo access to everyone
    
* Use `NOPASSWD` only when absolutely necessary
    
* Monitor `/etc/sudoers` and logs for misuse
    
* Use **groups** to manage sudo access
    
* Avoid `sudo su` – defeats the whole point of sudo 🙅‍♂️
    

## 🔒 Locking, Unlocking & Expiring User Accounts in Linux

Sometimes, you need to temporarily **disable a user**, lock down a suspicious account, or set an account to automatically expire after a specific date.

Let’s break down how to control user access without deleting them.

### 🔐 Locking a User Account

You can lock a user account with:

```bash
sudo usermod -L username
```

This **prevents login** by placing an exclamation mark `!` before the encrypted password in `/etc/shadow`.

🔍 Example:

```bash
sudo usermod -L john
```

Verify it:

```bash
sudo grep john /etc/shadow
```

Look for a `!` like:

```bash
john:!$6$XYZ...:...
```

### 🔓 Unlocking a User Account

To reverse the lock:

```bash
sudo usermod -U username
```

Example:

```bash
sudo usermod -U john
```

### 📅 Expire a User Account on a Specific Date

To set an **expiry date** for a user (after which they cannot log in):

```bash
sudo chage -E YYYY-MM-DD username
```

🔍 Example:

```bash
sudo chage -E 2025-05-31 john
```

This means after May 31, 2025, user **john** will not be able to log in.

### ⏳ Check Expiry Information

Use `chage -l` to **list the account aging** info:

```bash
sudo chage -l john
```

You’ll see output like:

```bash
Account expires              : May 31, 2025
Password inactive           : never
Password must be changed    : never
Last password change        : Apr 15, 2025
```

### ❌ Set Immediate Expiry (Disable Login Right Now)

```bash
sudo usermod --expiredate 1 john
```

That’s a quick way to **expire an account instantly**.

### 🧯 Troubleshooting Table

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User still logs in after lock | Active SSH session | `pkill -u username` or reboot |
| Login says "account expired" | Expiry date passed | `sudo chage -E -1 username` to remove expiry |
| Lock doesn’t work | User uses SSH key | Revoke key manually from `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` |

### 💡 Real Use Cases

* **Security Incident?** Lock the account immediately.
    
* **Temporary Users or Vendors?** Set expiry.
    
* **Employee Left the Company?** Expire now, delete later.
    
* **Exam Simulation?** RHCSA loves to ask about locking & expiring accounts.
    

## 🔐 Linux Authentication Concepts

Authentication in Linux is all about **verifying who the user is** and ensuring they have the **right permissions to access resources**. It’s what controls logins, password checking, sudo access, SSH, services — everything that needs access control.

Let’s explore the core concepts now 👇

### 🧩 What is PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)?

**PAM** is a **modular authentication framework** used in Linux. It’s the system behind the scenes that controls:

* Login (TTY, GUI, SSH)
    
* `sudo`
    
* Changing passwords
    
* Locking accounts
    
* And more…
    

🧠 Think of PAM as a set of building blocks. Each block handles one step — like checking passwords, account expiration, or even using fingerprint or OTP.

### 📁 PAM Configuration Files

* **Main config file**: `/etc/pam.conf` (mostly unused now)
    
* **Module-based config directory**: `/etc/pam.d/`
    

Each service (like `login`, `sshd`, `sudo`, `passwd`) has its own PAM config file inside `/etc/pam.d/`

📌 For example:

```bash
/etc/pam.d/sshd
/etc/pam.d/sudo
/etc/pam.d/common-auth   # Debian/Ubuntu
/etc/pam.d/system-auth   # RHEL/CentOS
```

### 🔧 PAM Module Types

Each PAM line has four fields:

```bash
<type>  <control>  <module_path>  <arguments>
```

| Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `auth` | Verifies user identity (password, biometrics) |
| `account` | Checks account status (expiration, restrictions) |
| `password` | Handles password changes |
| `session` | Manages session setup & cleanup (mounting home, limits, etc.) |

👀 **Example** (from `/etc/pam.d/sudo`):

```bash
auth    required    pam_env.so
auth    required    pam_unix.so
```

This means: use environment setup (`pam_`[`env.so`](http://env.so)) and password check (`pam_`[`unix.so`](http://unix.so)) before allowing `sudo`.

### 🔐 Common PAM Modules

| Module | What it Does |
| --- | --- |
| `pam_`[`unix.so`](http://unix.so) | Standard Unix auth (password, shadow) |
| `pam_`[`tally2.so`](http://tally2.so) | Account lockout after failed attempts |
| `pam_`[`faillock.so`](http://faillock.so) | Fail attempts tracking (used in RHEL 7+) |
| `pam_`[`limits.so`](http://limits.so) | Resource limits (memory, open files, etc.) |
| `pam_`[`sss.so`](http://sss.so) | Integrates with SSSD (LDAP, Kerberos) |

### ⚙️ Real-Time Use Cases for PAM

1. **Lock account after 3 failed login attempts** (RHEL/CentOS 8+): Edit `/etc/security/faillock.conf`:
    
    ```bash
    deny=3
    unlock_time=300
    ```
    
2. **Enforce password complexity**: Edit `/etc/security/pwquality.conf`:
    
    ```bash
    minlen = 8
    dcredit = -1
    ucredit = -1
    ```
    
3. **Log every sudo attempt**: PAM will automatically log sudo access to `/var/log/secure` or `/var/log/auth.log`
    

### 🧠 What is LDAP / OpenLDAP?

LDAP = **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol**  
OpenLDAP = Open-source implementation of LDAP

It’s a **centralized authentication service**, often used in enterprises where hundreds or thousands of users are managed.

Instead of creating users on each Linux server manually, LDAP allows: ✅ Centralized user management  
✅ Single sign-on (SSO) across multiple machines  
✅ Integration with Active Directory

### 🛠️ Real-World LDAP Usage (Example)

In an organization:

* Dev, QA, and Prod servers authenticate all users from a **central LDAP server**
    
* If a user is removed from LDAP, access is revoked across all machines instantly
    
* You can manage password policies, groups, permissions — all in one place
    

🧪 Configuration involves:

* `nslcd`, `sssd` or `ldap-utils` packages
    
* PAM + NSS configuration
    
* `/etc/nsswitch.conf`, `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf`, `/etc/pam.d/*`
    

### 🔐 LDAP vs PAM – What's the Difference?

| Feature | PAM | LDAP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Role | Local auth mechanism | Centralized directory & auth |
| Scope | Manages how authentication happens | Manages *who* authenticates |
| Common Usage | Controls password check, limits, etc. | Manages user accounts across systems |

🧠 PAM can be configured to **use LDAP as a backend**. So they work together!

### 🛡️ Best Practices for Linux Authentication

* Always **enforce strong password policies** via PAM
    
* Use **LDAP/OpenLDAP or Active Directory** for large infra
    
* Monitor **auth logs** for anomalies (`/var/log/auth.log` or `/var/log/secure`)
    
* Disable direct root login over SSH (`PermitRootLogin no`)
    
* **Use SSH keys** instead of passwords for remote login
    
* Enable **2FA/MFA** (via `pam_google_`[`authenticator.so`](http://authenticator.so) or Duo)
    

### 🧯 Troubleshooting Tips

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| PAM misconfigured | Use a rescue mode or boot ISO to restore config |
| LDAP login fails | Check `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf` and restart `sssd` service |
| PAM errors in sudo | Review `/etc/pam.d/sudo` and check syntax via `visudo` |
| Shadow file issues | Run `pwck`, `grpck` to verify user/account integrity |

## 🔚 **Conclusion – Wrapping Up Part 2**
