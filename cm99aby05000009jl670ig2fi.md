In our last blog, we explored the **Linux file system**, its structure, how to **navigate** through it, and the concept of **file system paths**.

Today, we’re diving deeper into:

* Different **types of files** in Linux
    
* How to **create files and directories**
    
* How to **search for them efficiently**
    

But before that — let’s clear up a common confusion:

### 🧠 What is “root” in Linux?

Many beginners get confused with the term "root" because it’s used in different contexts. In Linux, **“root” can refer to three different things** — so let’s break it down:

1. **Root Directory**: `/`  
    The top-level directory of the entire Linux file system.
    
2. **Root User (Account)**: `root`  
    The superuser with full administrative privileges.
    
3. **Root’s Home Directory**: `/root`  
    The home directory of the root user.
    

📝 **Note**: Don't confuse `/root` with `/` — one is the entire file system’s base, and the other is just the root user’s personal space.

Be careful while dealing with these — especially when working with paths or permissions. Misunderstanding this can lead to critical mistakes. 😅

### 🗂️ Types of Files in Linux

When you run the command `ls -l`, you’ll notice the **first character** in each line — it represents the **type of file**.

Linux supports **7 types of files**:

* `-` → **Regular File**  
    These include **text files**, **images**, **videos**, **scripts**, and **executable binaries**.
    
* `d` → **Directory**  
    These are folders that store files and other directories.
    
* `l` → **Symbolic Link (Soft Link)**  
    A reference or shortcut to another file.
    
* `c` → **Character Device File**  
    Special files used to represent **hardware devices** that transfer data **character-by-character** (e.g., keyboard, mouse).
    
* `s` → **Socket File**  
    Used for **network communication** between processes, enabling **data exchange**.
    
* `p` → **Named Pipe (FIFO)**  
    Enables **inter-process communication (IPC)** — data flows in a **First In First Out** manner between processes.
    
* `b` → **Block Device File**  
    These handle data in **blocks**, like **hard drives** and **USB drives**.
    

📝 **Tip**: Try running `ls -l /dev` to see a bunch of special files (especially `b` and `c` types) on your system!

> 💡 **Note:**  
> As a Linux Admin, you will regularly work with almost all types of files — such as regular files, directories, symbolic links, block devices, and character devices.
> 
> While **sockets (**`s`) and **named pipes (**`p`) are essential for inter-process communication and backend service interactions, they are not something you’ll deal with frequently on a daily basis unless you're working deeply with system-level programming or service architecture.

### 🔗 Hard Link vs Soft Link in Linux

When you create a file in Linux, its actual **data is stored in blocks on a block device** (like a hard disk). However, Linux doesn't rely solely on filenames to keep track of files. Instead, it uses a special structure called an **inode**.

An **inode** contains important **metadata** about a file, such as:

* File type
    
* Permissions
    
* Owner and group
    
* Size
    
* Timestamps (created, modified, accessed)
    
* Pointers to the actual data blocks on the disk
    

So, whenever you access a file (using commands like `cat`, `vi`, `less`, or `more`), the operating system uses the **inode number** to fetch the file’s metadata and locate its contents on the disk — **not the filename** directly.

### 🔗 Understanding Hard Links in Linux

Now that you understand how **inodes** work, let’s dive into **hard links** and how they function under the hood.

When people say *“a hard link doesn’t take up space”* or *“it acts like a backup”*, they’re referring to how hard links interact with inodes and the file system.

Let’s break it down:

Suppose you have a file named `file1`. When you create a hard link named `file2`, \*\*both `file1` and `file2` point to the **same inode**. That means:

* When you open `file2`, the OS checks its inode.
    
* The inode contains the metadata and pointers to the actual **data blocks** on the disk.
    
* So whether you access `file1` or `file2`, you're reading the same data from the same disk blocks.
    

#### 🧠 How it works under the hood:

```nginx
Filename (file2) ➝ Inode ➝ Data blocks on disk
```

Initially, it may sound a bit tricky, but it’s simply about understanding that:

### Example

Let’s say you have a file named `file1` and you want to create a hard link named `file2`.

```bash
# Step 1: Create the original file
echo "This is the original file" > file1

# Step 2: Create a hard link to file1
ln file1 file2

# Step 3: Check inode numbers and content
ls -li file1 file2
```

**Output will look like:**

```bash
123456 -rw-r--r-- 2 user user 27 Apr  9 10:00 file1
123456 -rw-r--r-- 2 user user 27 Apr  9 10:00 file2
```

🧠 **Explanation:**

* Both `file1` and `file2` have the **same inode number** → pointing to the same data blocks.
    
* You can edit either file, and changes reflect in both.
    
* When a hard link is created, the **inode reference count increases to 2**.
    
* If you delete `file1`, `file2` still works, because the inode reference count becomes 1, and the data remains accessible.
    
* The **actual data on disk is only removed when all hard links to an inode are deleted**, i.e., the inode reference count reaches 0.
    

> 📝 **Note:**  
> Hard links **only work within the same file system**. That's because inode numbers are **unique only within their own file system**.

### 🔗 Understanding Soft Links (Symbolic Links) in Linux

After learning about **hard links**, let’s now talk about **soft links**, also known as **symbolic links**.

A **soft link** is more like a **shortcut** or an **alias** that points to another file **by its name/path**, not by its inode. It doesn’t point to the actual data like a hard link — instead, it redirects you to the original file.

#### 📂 How Soft Link Works:

* When you create a soft link `file2` for an original file `file1`, `file2` stores the **path** to `file1`.
    
* When you try to access `file2`, the system follows the path and accesses the content of `file1`.
    

```bash
Soft link (file2) ➝ Path ➝ file1 ➝ Inode ➝ Data blocks
```

#### 💡 Key Points:

* A soft link **has a different inode number** than the original file.
    
* If the **original file is deleted**, the soft link becomes **broken** or **dangling** (it points to nothing).
    
* Soft links **can span across file systems** (unlike hard links).
    
* You can create soft links for **directories**, which is **not allowed** for hard links (without special options).
    

### Example

Let’s say you have a file named `file1` and you want to create a soft link named `file2` like mentioned above,

```bash
# Step 1: Create the original file
echo "This is the original file" > file1

# Step 2: Create a soft link to file1
ln -s file1 file2

# Step 3: Check the link
ls -li file1 file2
```

**Output might look like:**

```bash
123456 -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 27 Apr  9 10:00 file1
123789 lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user  5 Apr  9 10:01 file2 -> file1
```

🧠 **Explanation:**

* `file2` is just a **pointer** to `file1` (you can see the `->`).
    
* They have **different inode numbers**.
    
* If you **delete the original file** (`file1`), `file2` becomes a **broken link**.
    

📌 **Note:**

* Soft links **can cross filesystems**.
    
* You can also create soft links to **directories**.
    

#### 🔍 Quick Comparison:

| Feature | Hard Link | Soft Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inode Shared? | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Works Across FS? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Broken if Original Deleted? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Link to Directory? | ❌ No (generally) | ✅ Yes |
| Acts like Alias? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

> 🧠 **Pro Tip:**  
> Use `ls -l` to check links:
> 
> * Hard links will **not show an arrow** (`➝`) in output.
>     
> * Soft links will show something like: `file2 ➝ file1`
>     

Now that you understand both hard and soft links, let’s move on to **creating files and directories** in Linux!

### 📝 Creating Files and Directories in Linux

There are multiple ways we can create regular files and directories in Linux. Let’s explore the most common commands used for this.

#### 📁 **Creating Files**

1. `touch` – Used to create an empty file.
    
    ```bash
    touch file1.txt
    ```
    
    This command creates an empty file named `file1.txt`.
    
2. `cp` – Used to copy an existing file.
    
    ```bash
    cp file1.txt file2.txt
    ```
    
    This creates a copy of `file1.txt` named `file2.txt`.
    
3. `vi` or `vim` – Used to create and edit a file.
    
    ```bash
    vi file3.txt
    ```
    
    This opens the `vi` editor. Once inside, press `i` to enter insert mode, type your content, press `Esc`, then type `:wq` to save and exit.  
    👉 *We’ll discuss* `vi` editor in more detail in future blogs — for now, just remember these basic steps.
    

#### 📂 **Creating Directories**

1. `mkdir` – Used to create a directory.
    
    ```bash
    mkdir myfolder
    ```
    
    This command creates a directory named `myfolder`.
    
2. `cp -R` – Used to copy directories recursively.
    
    ```bash
    cp -R myfolder newfolder
    ```
    
    This creates a copy of `myfolder` (and all its contents) into `newfolder`.
    

### 🔍 Searching Files and Directories in Linux

Now that we know how to create files and directories, what if you forget **where** you created them? Instead of manually checking each folder, Linux provides two powerful commands to help you search:

> ✅ <mark>find </mark> and ✅ <mark>locate</mark>

Both are used to search for files or directories, but they work in different ways.

---

#### 🔎 `find` – Deep, Real-Time Search

`find` scans the filesystem in **real time**, which makes it accurate but slightly slower.

**Syntax:**

```bash
find <path> <criteria> <action>
```

**Examples:**

1. **Find by name in current directory:**
    
    ```bash
    find . -name file1.txt
    ```
    
2. **Find by name (case-insensitive):**
    
    ```bash
    find / -iname file1.txt
    ```
    
3. **Find all** `.txt` files:
    
    ```bash
    find /home -type f -name "*.txt"
    ```
    
4. **Find directories named "project":**
    
    ```bash
    find / -type d -name project
    ```
    
5. **Find files modified in last 1 day:**
    
    ```bash
    find /var/log -mtime -1
    ```
    
6. **Find files larger than 100MB:**
    
    ```bash
    find / -type f -size +100M
    ```
    
7. **Find and delete** `.tmp` files: ⚠️ Use with caution!
    
    ```bash
    find /tmp -type f -name "*.tmp" -delete
    ```
    

### ✅ Step-by-step: Find and copy files with **SUID** and **SGID**

#### 🔍 1. Find files with **SUID** permission:

```bash
find / -type f -perm -4000 -exec cp --parents {} /tmp/special-perms/suid/ \; 2>/dev/null
```

#### 🔍 2. Find files with **SGID** permission:

```bash
find / -type f -perm -2000 -exec cp --parents {} /tmp/special-perms/sgid/ \; 2>/dev/null
```

### 📂 What this does:

* `/` → Search from the root directory.
    
* `-type f` → Only regular files.
    
* `-perm -4000` → Match files with **SUID** bit set.
    
* `-perm -2000` → Match files with **SGID** bit set.
    
* `-exec cp --parents {} /target/dir/ \;` → Copy files and preserve directory structure.
    
* `2>/dev/null` → Suppress permission denied errors.
    

### 🔧 Example:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/special-perms/suid
mkdir -p /tmp/special-perms/sgid
find / -type f -perm -4000 -exec cp --parents {} /tmp/special-perms/suid/ \; 2>/dev/null
find / -type f -perm -2000 -exec cp --parents {} /tmp/special-perms/sgid/ \; 2>/dev/null
```

#### 🚀 `locate` – Super Fast, Cached Search

`locate` uses a **prebuilt database** (like a cache), so it’s extremely fast but can give outdated results if the database isn’t updated.

**Examples:**

1. **Locate a file:**
    
    ```bash
    locate file1.txt
    ```
    
2. **Locate anything with “log” in the name:**
    
    ```bash
    locate log #to locate log file
    ```
    

**Note:**

* If `locate` returns nothing, you might need to update the database:
    
    ```bash
    updatedb #will update the database
    ```
    
* Also ensure `mlocate` package is installed:
    
    ```bash
    rpm -qa | grep mlocate  #to check mlocate installed or not
    yum install mlocate -y   # If not installed
    ```
    

These tools are must-haves for every Linux admin — especially when working in large environments with hundreds of files and folders!

> 🧠 **Note:**  
> The `locate` command is great when you want to **quickly search by file or directory name**, thanks to its speed and simplicity.
> 
> However, the `find` command is much **more powerful and flexible** — allowing you to search based on **name, size, modification time, file type, permissions**, and more (as shown in the examples above).
> 
> 👉 **Use whichever fits your requirement**. For quick searches: go with `locate`. For detailed or conditional searches: stick with `find`.

## 🔐 Coming Up Next: File Permissions in Linux

Next, we’ll explore one of the most crucial aspects of Linux system administration — **File Permissions**.

🔸 Decode the meaning behind `rwx` (read, write, execute)  
🔸 Understand **ownership** and how Linux enforces user and group access  
🔸 Get hands-on with commands like:  
 📌 `chmod` — modify file access permissions  
 📌 `chown` — change file ownership  
 📌 `chgrp` — assign group ownership

This is where true Linux power and control begin — don’t miss it! 🚀
