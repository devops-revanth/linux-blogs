## 🪵**System Logs –** `/var/log`

### 🔍 What is `/var/log`?

In Linux, the `/var/log` directory is your go-to place for **all system logs** — like a black box of your server. It contains logs related to the kernel, system boot, package installations, cron jobs, authentication attempts, and more.

Think of it like this:

> “When something breaks or behaves weirdly, your first stop should be `/var/log` — it’s where Linux speaks.”

---

### 📂 Common Files in `/var/log`:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/var/log/messages` | General system logs |
| `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages` | System events (Debian/RHEL) |
| `/var/log/secure` or `/var/log/auth.log` | Authentication & authorization logs |
| `/var/log/cron` | Cron job logs |
| `/var/log/dmesg` | Boot-time hardware messages |
| `/var/log/yum.log` | Package installation logs (yum) |
| `/var/log/httpd/` | Apache logs |

---

### 🧪 Example Usage:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/messages
```

> View logs in real-time.

```bash
less /var/log/secure
```

> Audit failed and successful login attempts.

```bash
grep -i "error" /var/log/messages
```

> Filter out all “error” lines for troubleshooting.

---

### ✅ Real-World Use Cases:

* **Login Failures**: See if someone’s trying to brute-force SSH.
    
* **Cron Jobs Not Running?** Check `/var/log/cron` for failures.
    
* **Disk or Hardware Warnings?** Check `/var/log/dmesg`.
    
* **Package Conflicts?** Review `/var/log/yum.log` or `/var/log/apt/history.log`.
    

---

### 🚧 Troubleshooting Tips:

* If log files are missing, ensure `rsyslog` or `journald` is running.
    
* Use `logrotate` to manage log sizes.
    

## 🔌 **System Maintenance Commands –** `shutdown`, `reboot`, `init`, `halt`

These are **essential commands** for safely managing system power states — whether you’re restarting after a config change or shutting down for hardware maintenance.

---

### 🔻 1. `shutdown`

Gracefully powers off or reboots the system **after warning users** and ensuring all processes stop cleanly.

#### 📌 Syntax:

```bash
shutdown [OPTION] [TIME] [MESSAGE]
```

#### 🧪 Examples:

```bash
sudo shutdown now
```

> Shuts down immediately.

```bash
sudo shutdown -r +5 "System rebooting for updates"
```

> Reboots in 5 minutes with a message sent to logged-in users.

```bash
sudo shutdown -c
```

> Cancels a scheduled shutdown.

---

### 🔄 2. `reboot`

Instantly reboots the machine. It’s like a fast-track version of `shutdown -r now`.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

> 💡 Best used for quick reboots when no warning is needed or during automation.

---

### ⏳ 3. `init`

Used to **change the system runlevel**. Primarily used in **SysVinit-based** systems (older Linux distros).

| Runlevel | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Halt |
| 1 | Single-user mode (maintenance) |
| 3 | Multi-user (non-GUI) |
| 5 | Multi-user with GUI |
| 6 | Reboot |

```bash
sudo init 0      # Poweroff
sudo init 6      # Reboot
```

> 🧠 Modern systems use `systemctl` instead, but knowing `init` is still useful for legacy systems.

---

### 🔘 4. `halt`

Immediately stops all CPU functions. The system shuts down but **does not power off** unless ACPI is enabled.

```bash
sudo halt
```

> ⚠️ Not recommended unless you **know what you're doing** — it doesn’t notify processes or users.

---

### ✅ Real-World Use Cases:

* **Scheduled Downtime**: `shutdown -r +10` to reboot during off-hours.
    
* **Remote Maintenance**: Schedule reboot via SSH for remote patching.
    
* **Emergency Halt**: Use `halt` if the system is unstable and unresponsive.
    
* **Legacy Servers**: Use `init` when working on older enterprise Linux servers.

## 🧭 **Finding System Information in Linux**

Knowing your system's identity, architecture, OS version, and hardware details is crucial for **troubleshooting, auditing, and automating** tasks. Here's how to gather that information quickly.

---

### 🔹 1. `hostname`

Displays or sets the name of your system on the network.

#### 🔧 Command:

```bash
hostname
```

#### 📌 Example:

```bash
hostname
```

> Output: `durgarevu-node1`

🧠 **Use case:**  
Check which system you are on — especially useful when managing multiple servers via SSH.

---

### 🔹 2. `hostnamectl`

Provides detailed information about the hostname, OS, and kernel — and lets you modify the hostname (in `systemd`\-based distros).

#### 🔧 Command:

```bash
hostnamectl
```

#### 📌 Example:

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname webserver-node
```

🧠 **Use case:**  
Used in automation scripts or when renaming a server for better role clarity (e.g., `db-node1`, `cache-server`).

---

### 🔹 3. `cat /etc/*release`

Displays the **OS version and distribution details.**

#### 🔧 Command:

```bash
cat /etc/*release
```

#### 📌 Output:

```bash
NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Linux"
VERSION="9.3 (Plow)"
```

🧠 **Use case:**  
Before installing a package or writing OS-specific logic in scripts, always check the OS release.

---

### 🔹 4. `uname`

Displays **system-level kernel and architecture info**.

#### 🔧 Useful Flags:

```bash
uname -a    # All info
uname -r    # Kernel version
uname -m    # Machine architecture
```

🧠 **Use case:**  
Ensure kernel compatibility with certain software or monitor kernel upgrades.

---

### 🔹 5. `arch`

Displays your CPU architecture (e.g., x86\_64, aarch64, i686).

#### 🔧 Command:

```bash
arch
```

> Output: `x86_64`

🧠 **Use case:**  
Helps when downloading packages — you need the right build for your architecture (32-bit vs 64-bit).

---

### 🔹 6. `dmidecode`

Displays **low-level hardware info**, like BIOS version, serial number, RAM slots, etc.

#### 🔧 Command:

```bash
sudo dmidecode
```

> Or a filtered version:

```bash
sudo dmidecode -t memory
```

🧠 **Use cases:**

* Check **RAM slots** before upgrade.
    
* Verify **BIOS version** before firmware patching.
    
* Retrieve **system serial number** for support cases.
    

---

### 🔄 Real-World Use Cases Recap:

* 📦 During software deployment: Verify OS and architecture (`cat /etc/*release`, `arch`)
    
* 🖥️ Hardware audits: Pull system details with `dmidecode`
    
* 🤖 Scripting: Conditionally execute commands based on `uname` or `hostnamectl`

## 🔐 Recovering Root Password via Single User Mode (`rd.break` Method)

Let’s imagine your root password is lost or forgotten. You can reset it by rebooting into **single user mode** using the **GRUB boot loader** and `rd.break`.

---

### 📸 Visual Explanation of Steps:

### 🖥️ **Step 1: Reboot the System**

```bash
sudo reboot
```

As the system restarts, you'll be taken to the **GRUB boot screen**.

---

### 📍 **Step 2: Enter GRUB Menu**

At the **GRUB screen**, use the **arrow keys** to highlight the default kernel (usually the first line), then press:

```bash
e
```

This lets you **edit the boot parameters**.

---

### 🧩 **Step 3: Add** `rd.break` to Kernel Line

Scroll down in the GRUB editor until you find the line starting with:

```bash
linux16 /vmlinuz...  # On RHEL 7
linux /vmlinuz...    # On RHEL 8/9
```

⬇️ Go to the end of that line and **append**:

```bash
rd.break
```

➡️ It should now look like:

```bash
linux /vmlinuz-... ro crashkernel=auto rhgb quiet rd.break
```

---

### 🟢 **Step 4: Boot Into Emergency Shell**

Now, press:

```bash
Ctrl + X
```

or

```bash
F10
```

The system will boot and drop you into the **initramfs shell**.

---

### 🔧 **Step 5: Remount the Root Filesystem as Read-Write**

```bash
mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
```

Then:

```bash
chroot /sysroot
```

You’re now **inside the system as root**, with full permissions.

---

### 🔑 **Step 6: Reset the Root Password**

```bash
passwd
```

➡️ Enter the new root password twice.

Example:

```bash
New password: Revanth@123
Retype new password: Revanth@123
```

✅ You’ll see: `passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.`

---

### 🔁 **Step 7: Re-enable SELinux Contexts**

To prevent boot issues due to SELinux labels:

```bash
touch /.autorelabel
```

---

### 🚪 **Step 8: Exit and Reboot**

Exit twice:

```bash
exit
exit
```

System will **reboot**, re-label SELinux, and you’re done ✅

---

## 🎯 Real-World Use Case

👨‍🔧 Imagine your organization’s root password was lost after a long break or system handover. You can’t wait for another sysadmin. You reboot, follow the above steps, and reset root access in under 5 minutes!

---

## 🛠️ `sosreport` – Collecting a Diagnostic Report for Support Teams

### 🔍 What is it?

`sosreport` collects **system configuration, logs, and diagnostic data** into a single archive. Ideal for **troubleshooting** and **escalating issues to Red Hat or support teams**.

---

### ✅ When to Use:

* System behaving unexpectedly.
    
* Performance issues.
    
* Hardware or kernel issues.
    
* Need to submit a case to Red Hat or internal DevOps.
    

---

### 📦 How It Works:

```bash
sudo sosreport
```

If this is the first time, install the package:

```bash
sudo yum install sos -y
```

---

### 🔐 During execution:

You’ll be prompted for:

* Your **name**.
    
* A **case ID or ticket number** (can leave blank).
    

Example:

```bash
Please enter your first initial and last name [revanth]:
Please enter the case id that you are generating this report for:
```

It will generate a tarball like:

```bash
/var/tmp/sosreport-server1-20250418-153212-2.tar.xz
```

📤 You can share this file with support or internal teams for diagnosis.

---

### 🎯 Real-Time Use Case

> "In production, a RHEL server was crashing intermittently. I ran `sosreport` before rebooting. The report captured logs, services, and kernel messages, which helped engineers identify a faulty driver."

---

## 🌍 `env` – Environment Variables at a Glance

### 📘 What is it?

The `env` command shows **all environment variables** currently set in your shell session.

---

### 📦 Usage:

```bash
env
```

Output:

```bash
SHELL=/bin/bash
USER=revanth
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
HOME=/home/revanth
```

---

### 🔍 Practical Use:

You want to check if `JAVA_HOME` or `PATH` is set properly before running a script:

```bash
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

If not set, you can export:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk
```

---

### 📘 Bonus: Persistent Environment Variables

#### 1️⃣ `.bashrc` (user-level, non-login shells)

* Located at: `~/.bashrc`
    
* Great for aliases, functions, PS1 customization
    

Example:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/tools
alias ll='ls -alF'
```

---

#### 2️⃣ `/etc/profile` (system-wide, login shells)

Affects **all users** when they log in.

Add global environment vars like:

```bash
export EDITOR=vim
```

---

#### 3️⃣ `/etc/bashrc` (system-wide, non-login shells)

Used for interactive **non-login** shells (like terminals opened from GUI).

---

### 🧠 Real-Time Use Case

> "You install Terraform manually and need it accessible to all users. Add it to `/etc/profile` or `/etc/bashrc` so PATH is globally available."

---

## 📢 BONUS: Check Default Shell

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

Example:

```bash
/bin/bash
```

You can change a user's shell:

```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh revanth
```
