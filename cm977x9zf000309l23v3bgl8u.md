> **Okay folks, so far we’ve been diving deep into theory—what Linux is, why it’s important, its history, how it compares to other operating systems like Unix and Windows, and a few key things to remember before getting started.**

Now it’s time for some **action**! 💻

We’re going to walk through **how to install Linux**—because no matter how much theory you know, the **real learning begins when you do it yourself**.

There are multiple ways to install Linux, and I highly recommend that you try doing it **at least 2 or 3 times** just for practice. If you're using **cloud platforms** (like AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.), you won’t be installing Linux manually—cloud providers usually give you pre-built images. But before that, let’s understand how it’s usually done.

### 🔧 Common Installation Methods:

1. **CD/DVD Installation**
    
2. **ISO File (Bootable Image)**
    
3. **Network Installation (PXE Boot, etc.)**
    

In this blog, I’ll walk you through the installation using an **ISO file**. It’s one of the easiest and most popular ways to get started.

I’m using **Oracle VirtualBox** to create a virtual machine and installing **AlmaLinux 9.5** using its ISO file.  
Don’t worry—I’ll guide you step-by-step with screenshots. 📸

> 💡 **Remember:** No matter how many tutorials you watch or articles you read—**you’ll learn best by doing it yourself.**

### 🛠️ Step 1: Creating a Virtual Machine

Once you’ve opened **Oracle VirtualBox**, click on **“New”** to create a new virtual machine.

> 💡 Here’s what I did:

As you can see in the screenshot above:

* I named my VM **TestVM**
    
* Chose a folder where my VM files will be stored
    
* Selected the **AlmaLinux 9.5 ISO** file from my local system
    

Other fields like **Type**, **Subtype**, and **Version** were automatically populated when I chose the ISO.

✅ That's it! You can **click "Finish"**—no need to tweak anything else for now.

🖥️ Once the virtual machine starts, you'll see the AlmaLinux 9.5 boot menu.

Here, I selected the **"Install AlmaLinux 9.5"** option using the arrow keys and hit **Enter** to begin the installation process.

🌐 After selecting the **“Install AlmaLinux 9.5”** option, the installer will prompt you to choose your preferred language.

I selected **English (United States)** for this setup. You can choose any language based on your comfort and requirements. Once selected, click **Continue** to proceed with the installation.

🧭 After clicking **Continue**, you’ll land on the **Installation Summary** page — this is the main configuration screen where you need to review and customize the installation settings.

You'll mainly focus on the sections marked in **red**, as they are mandatory to proceed.

### 🔧 Key Areas to Configure:

* **Installation Destination:**  
    This is where you select the disk or partition where AlmaLinux should be installed. I used the default automatic partitioning option for simplicity.
    
* **Software Selection:**  
    Here, you can choose the environment you want to install.  
    👉 If you're just starting out, go with **Server with GUI**.  
    👉 If you're comfortable with the terminal or want to practice, select **Minimal Install** (CLI only).  
    For this setup, I chose **CLI** to keep things lightweight.
    
* **Time & Date:**  
    This is optional — you can select your region now or adjust it later. I set mine to **Asia/Kolkata**.
    
* **User Settings:**  
    You can either:
    
    * Set a **Root Password**
        
    * Or create a **User Account** (✅ *Recommended for security best practices*)  
        I chose to create a new user instead of logging in as root.

Once all the required settings are completed, click **Begin Installation** to proceed.

### ⚙️ Installation in Progress

Once you click **Begin Installation**, the installation process will start. You’ll see a progress bar as AlmaLinux begins setting up your system.

At this stage, the installer will:

* Create disk partitions (like `/dev/sda2`)
    
* Set up LVM (Logical Volume Manager)
    
* Install the base operating system and selected software packages
    

⏳ This might take a few minutes depending on your system's resources. Sit back and let it complete the setup.

✅ **Tip:** Don’t shut down or restart the VM during this process.

### 🎉 Installation Complete – Reboot and You're Done!

Once all packages are installed, you’ll see the **Installation Complete** screen.

✅ AlmaLinux is now successfully installed and ready to use!

📌 **Final Step**: Click on the **Reboot System** button in the bottom right corner.

After rebooting:

* If you created a user, log in with that.
    
* If you only set a root password, log in as `root`.
    

You’ve officially completed the AlmaLinux installation. Great job! 👏

> 📝 **Note:** Wait a minute — I’ve completed the installation. Now, how can I access it? Follow the steps below.

### 🖥️ How to Access Your AlmaLinux VM

Now that the installation is complete, it's time to **access your VM** and start working on it. There are **two primary ways** to do this:

---

#### 🔹 1. Console Access (Local)

Initially, you'll **need to use the console** to get network information — especially the IP address — before you can access it remotely.

📌 **Steps:**

1. From VirtualBox, open the **Console (VM window)**.
    
2. Log in with the **user credentials** you created during installation.
    
3. Open the terminal and run the following command to get your IP address:
    

```bash
$ip a
```

> 📝 Note:  
> The older `ifconfig` command is **deprecated** starting from RHEL 7.5 and later (including AlmaLinux). If you still want to use it, you can install the `net-tools` package:

```bash
sudo yum install net-tools
```

---

#### 🔹 2. Remote Access (SSH)

Once you have your **IP address**, you can **remotely access** your VM using SSH.

📌 **SSH Syntax:**

```bash
ssh username@ip_address
```

🔒 Example:

```bash
ssh devuser@192.168.56.101
```

> Replace `devuser` with your actual username and `192.168.56.101` with your machine's IP address.

---

After logging in to your Linux system, you’ll notice two common symbols in the terminal prompt: `$` and `#`. These symbols help you identify the type of user you are logged in as.

### 💡 What do `$` and `#` mean?

* `$` — This symbol indicates that you are logged in as a **regular (non-root) user**.
    
    * 🔸 *Example:*
        
        ```bash
        user@localhost:~$  
        ```
        
        This means the current user is named `user` and does **not** have administrative privileges.
        
* `#` — This symbol means you are logged in as the **root (superuser)**.
    
    * 🔸 *Example:*
        
        ```bash
        root@localhost:~#  
        ```
        
        This means you have full access and can perform administrative tasks on the system.
        

🛑 **Be careful when logged in as root** — you have the power to change system-level settings or even break the system if you're not cautious.
