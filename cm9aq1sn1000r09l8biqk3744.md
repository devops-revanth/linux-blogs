👋 Hey Everyone!

It’s been **5 days** since I started writing blogs, and I hope I continue this journey consistently. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to share — it’ll help me grow and improve even more. 💬🙏

Now let’s jump back into our Linux learning series! So far, we’ve explored:

📁 File types  
🛠️ How to create files and directories  
🔍 How to search for files effectively

In today’s blog, we’ll take things one step further by discussing **file permissions and ownership** — understanding **who** can do **what** with a file.

But before we go there, let’s quickly address something we’ve been seeing a lot

### 🔍 How Do We See File Permissions in Linux?

If you’ve been following along, you probably noticed that we often use:

```bash
ls -l
```

...to list files. But wait — what **exactly** is that `-l` doing?

We’ve been using it all along, but we **never really discussed the full syntax** of Linux commands! So before jumping into **file permissions and ownership**, let’s understand what’s happening behind the scenes with that `-l`.

### 🧾 Linux Command Syntax

In Linux, commands generally follow this basic pattern:

```bash
command [option(s)] [argument(s)]
```

#### 🔹 Options:

* Modify the behavior of the command.
    
* Usually start with a hyphen (`-`) followed by one or more letters.
    
* Example: `-l` gives you a long listing format in `ls`.
    
* You can **combine options** together:  
    👉 `ls -ltr` is the same as `ls -l -t -r`.
    

#### 🔹 Arguments:

* These are the targets the command operates on.
    
* They can be **files, directories, users**, etc.
    
* Some commands **require** arguments, while others have **defaults**.
    
* Example:
    
    ```bash
    ls -l raju
    ```
    
    You might see an output like this:
    
    ```bash
    -rw-r--r-- 1 revanth revanth 4096 Apr  9 18:00 raju
    ```
    
* In this case, `raju` is the **argument**. If a file or directory named `raju` exists, it will be listed in long format.
    

### 🔐 Understanding File Permissions in Linux

Linux is a **multi-user operating system**, which means multiple users can work on the same machine at the same time. Naturally, this raises an important question:

> **How do you protect your files from being accessed or modified by others?**

That’s where **file permissions** come into play. Just like you have the responsibility of safeguarding your system as a Linux admin, **each user is responsible for controlling access to their files and directories**.

---

### 🛡️ Why Do We Use File Permissions?

Simple: **To protect your environment**.

Permissions help:

* Prevent unauthorized users from **viewing** your files.
    
* Stop others from **deleting or modifying** important directories or scripts.
    
* Ensure only the right users can **execute** programs.
    

### 🔧 Viewing File Permissions

Permissions for a file or directory can be **viewed using**:

```bash
ls -l
```

As we saw earlier in the example of `ls -l raju`, the first part of the output tells us about permissions:

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 revanth revanth 4096 Apr  9 18:00 raju
```

That first section `-rw-r--r--` is the **permission string**, and here’s how it works:

---

### 📜 Types of Permissions

There are **3 types** of permissions in Linux:

| Symbol | Permission | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `r` | Read | View the contents of a file or list a directory |
| `w` | Write | Modify the file or directory contents |
| `x` | Execute | Run a script/program (for files), or **enter** a directory (for directories) |

---

### 👥 Who Gets These Permissions?

Permissions can be set for **3 levels** of users:

| Symbol | Level | Who it refers to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `u` | User | The **owner** of the file (you!) |
| `g` | Group | Users who belong to the same group |
| `o` | Others | All other users on the system |

**Example from earlier:**

### **\-rw-r--r--**

This means:

* **User (u):** rw- **→** **Read & Write**
    
* **Group (g):** r-- **→Read**
    
* **Others (o):** r-- **→ Read**
    

---

> 🧠 **Note:**  
> For **files**, `x` is needed to **execute** scripts/programs.  
> For **directories**, `x` is needed to **enter** the directory.

### 🔐 Now That We Understand Permissions… How Do We Change Them?

Once you understand how file permissions work in Linux, the next step is learning **how to modify them** to control access effectively. And that’s where the `chmod` command comes in.

### 🛠️ Command to Change File Permissions: `chmod`

If you ever get stuck, remember you can always refer to the manual:

```bash
man chmod
```

or

```bash
chmod --help
```

### ✅ Symbolic Mode – Human Readable Way

In symbolic mode, you specify which permission (read, write, execute) you want to **add (+)** or **remove (–)** for a **user (u)**, **group (g)**, or **others (o)**.

Some examples:

```bash
chmod g+w raju       # Adds write permission to group
chmod u-w raju       # Removes write permission from user
chmod a-r raju       # Removes read permission from all (user, group, others)
chmod u+rw raju      # Adds read and write permission for the user
chmod g+rw raju      # Adds read and write permission for group
chmod o+r raju       # Adds read permission for others
```

---

### 🔢 Numeric (Octal) Mode – Fast and Efficient

Each permission is assigned a numeric value:

* **Read (r) = 4**
    
* **Write (w) = 2**
    
* **Execute (x) = 1**
    

To set permissions using numbers, you **add the values** together:

| Permission | Value |
| --- | --- |
| r (Read) | 4 |
| w (Write) | 2 |
| x (Execute) | 1 |

Examples:

```bash
chmod 444 raju   # Read-only for everyone
chmod 644 raju   # rw for user, r for group and others
chmod 755 raju   # rwx for user, rx for group and others
```

🎯 Tip: The order always goes **User → Group → Others** in numeric format.

### 🔁 Bonus: Recursive Permission Changes

Sometimes, you may want to apply permission or ownership changes **not just to a single file or directory**, but also to **all the files and subdirectories inside it**. This is where **recursive options** come into play.

### ✅ Recursive `chmod`

To change **permissions** for all files and directories inside a given directory:

```bash
chmod -R 755 /dir
```

* `-R` stands for **recursive**
    
* `755` gives:
    
    * User → Read, write, execute
        
    * Group & Others → Read, execute
        

This command will apply the same permission to **every file and subdirectory** within `/dir`.

### ⚠️ Use with Caution!

Recursive commands affect **all content** under the specified path — so double-check before running them, especially with `sudo`!

### 🧑‍💻 File Ownership in Linux

In Linux, every file and directory has an **owner** and a **group** associated with it. Managing these properly is essential for ensuring proper access control and security.

---

#### 🔧 Ownership Commands:

* `chown` – Changes the **owner** (user) and/or **group** of a file or directory.
    
    > Only the **root** user can execute `chown`.
    
    ```bash
    sudo chown raju file.txt            # Change owner to 'raju'
    sudo chown raju:devops file.txt     # Change owner to 'raju' and group to 'devops'
    sudo chown -R raju:devops /project  # Recursively change ownership inside /project
    ```
    
* `chgrp` – Changes the **group ownership** of a file or directory.
    
    ```bash
    chgrp devops file.txt               # Change group to 'devops'
    chgrp -R devops /project            # Recursively change group in /project
    ```
    

---

### ✅ Recursive `chown`

To change **ownership** of a directory and everything inside it:

```bash
chown -R username:groupname /dir
```

* `-R` again is **recursive**
    
* `username:groupname` is the new owner and group you're assigning
    

This is useful when moving project files between users or setting up shared directories.

### ⚠️ Use with Caution!

Recursive commands affect **all content** under the specified path — so double-check before running them, especially with `sudo`!

### 📌 Important Note: File Deletion ≠ File Ownership

A **user can delete a file even if they do not own it**, provided they have the correct permissions on the directory containing the file.

#### 📂 Example Scenario:

* 👤 **User**: `raju`
    
* 📄 **File**: `/home/raju/test`
    
* 🔐 **File Owner**: `root:root`
    
* 📝 **File Permissions**: `-rw-r--r--`
    
* 📁 **Directory**: `/home/raju`
    
* 🔑 **Directory Owner**: `raju`
    
* 🔒 **Directory Permissions**: `rwx------`
    

Even though **Raju is not the owner** of the file (`test`), he **can delete it** because he has:

* **Write (w)** permission on the directory — allows modifying contents (like deleting files).
    
* **Execute (x)** permission on the directory — allows entering into the directory.
    

## 🔐 Important Permission Rules in Linux

Understanding how permissions work is essential to secure your Linux system effectively. Here are **key rules** to remember when dealing with files and directories:

---

### ✅ To **Delete a File**:

A user needs:

* ✅ **Write (**`w`) permission on the directory (to modify directory contents)
    
* ✅ **Execute (**`x`) permission on the directory (to access the directory)
    

📌 **Note:** The permission on the file itself **doesn’t matter** for deletion. It is the **directory's permissions** that control it.

---

### ✅ To **Read a File**:

A user must have:

* ✅ **Read (**`r`) permission **on the file itself**
    

---

## 🚫 How to Prevent File Deletion by Others?

Here are some ways to **protect your files from being deleted**:

### 🔹 1. Remove Write Permission on the Directory

```bash
chmod -w /home/raju
```

> ⚠️ This prevents **file deletion** AND **file creation** in the directory.

---

### 🔹 2. Use ACLs (Access Control Lists)

ACLs allow **fine-grained control** beyond standard permission bits.

```bash
setfacl -m u:username:--- /home/raju
```

---

### 🔹 3. Move Files to a Secure Directory

Another safe option is to move sensitive files into a directory with **restricted access** (e.g., `700` permissions) where only the owner can access.

```bash
mkdir /secure
chmod 700 /secure
mv important_file.txt /secure/
```

## 🔒 What is ACL (Access Control List)?

Think of **ACL** as an **additional security layer** that runs **on top of standard Linux file permissions**.

* It allows **more flexible** and **fine-grained** control over who can access files and directories.
    
* You can **assign permissions to specific users or groups**—even if they are **not the owner** or **part of the file’s group**.
    

---

### 📘 Why Use ACL?

Let’s say:

* A file is owned by `root`
    
* You want to allow **only one specific user** (not part of root group) to read that file.
    

You could use:

* `chmod o+r file` → But this gives read access to **everyone** (not secure ❌)
    

✅ **With ACL**, you can allow **only that one user** to read the file, while keeping it restricted from others.

---

### 📌 From Linux man pages:

> ACLs are used to define more **fine-grained discretionary access rights** for files and directories.

---

## 🛠️ ACL Commands

### ➕ Add ACL Permission

```bash
# Give rwx permission to a user
setfacl -m u:john:rwx test

# Give read-write permission to a group
setfacl -m g:developers:rw test
```

### 🔁 Recursive ACL (Inherit ACL from Directory)

```bash
setfacl -Rm u:john:rw /dir
```

### ❌ Remove Specific ACL Entry

```bash
setfacl -x u:john test
```

### 🧹 Remove All ACL Entries

```bash
setfacl -b test
```

---

## 📍 How Do You Know ACL Is Set?

After assigning ACLs, you'll notice a `+` symbol at the end of the permission string when running `ls -l`.

### Example:

```bash
ls -l test
-rw-r--r--+ 1 root root 0 Apr 9 10:00 test
```

> That `+` indicates **ACL is active** on the file.

You can view ACL entries using:

```bash
getfacl test
```

---

### ⚠️ Important Note

Even if a user has **write (**`w`) permission via ACL, they **still can’t delete the file** unless they have write & execute permissions on the **directory** it resides in — same rule as standard permissions.

---

### 🎯 Why ACL Was Introduced?

ACLs solve a simple but powerful problem:

> “I want to allow **only one user** (not everyone) to access a file they don’t own.”

ACL = **Permission precision without overexposure.**

### 🔚 Wrapping Up

In this blog, we explored the world of **Linux file permissions**, **ownership**, and the powerful concept of **ACLs**. We started with understanding how permissions are displayed using `ls -l`, broke down the meaning of `rwx`, and learned how to change permissions with `chmod` (both symbolic and numeric methods). We also discussed ownership with `chown` and `chgrp`, and finally touched on **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** for fine-grained permission control.

Key takeaways:

* Use `ls -l` to view file permissions.
    
* Change permissions using `chmod`, ownership using `chown`, and groups with `chgrp`.
    
* For advanced control, use ACLs via `setfacl` and `getfacl`.
    
* Don’t forget the recursive power of `chmod -R` and `chown -R` when dealing with directories!
    

Understanding these fundamentals gives you more control, security, and confidence while working in any Linux environment — especially as an aspiring DevOps or Linux administrator.
