## 🔐 SSH vs Telnet – Secure vs Unsecure Remote Access in Linux

### 🚀 Overview

Remote administration is crucial in managing Linux systems—whether you're deploying web servers, maintaining configurations, or just accessing a remote terminal. Two tools commonly associated with remote access are **Telnet** and **SSH**.

---

### 🧪 What is Telnet?

**Telnet** (short for *Teletype Network*) was one of the earliest remote login protocols. It enables you to connect to another machine and use it as if you were sitting in front of it.  
But here’s the caveat: it’s **not secure**.

#### 🔓 Why is Telnet Unsecure?

* It transmits data—including **usernames and passwords—in plain text**
    
* Susceptible to **eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks**
    
* Not recommended for production or public environments
    

#### 💻 Usage:

```bash
telnet <hostname or IP>
```

#### 📌 Real Use Case (Only for Testing):

In a **closed, isolated lab environment**, Telnet can be used to simulate remote connections without encryption. For instance, testing firewall rules or learning basic client-server behavior.

### 🚀 **SSH (Secure Shell) – Remote Access the Secure Way**

#### 🔐 **What is SSH?**

SSH stands for **Secure Shell**. It's a cryptographic network protocol that allows users to securely access and manage devices over an unsecured network. It's the most widely used tool for **remote administration** of Linux systems.

Unlike Telnet (which sends data in plain text), **SSH encrypts** all traffic (including passwords), providing **confidentiality and integrity**.

---

#### 🔧 **How It Works – Client & Server Architecture**

There are two key components in SSH:

* **SSH Client**: The system used to initiate the connection.
    
* **SSH Server**: The system you connect to (must have the `sshd` service running).
    

---

#### 🔍 **Real-World Use Cases**

1. **Remote Server Access**: Admins can log into remote Linux servers to perform maintenance.
    
2. **Secure File Transfers**: Using `scp` or `sftp`, files can be moved securely.
    
3. **Tunneling**: You can forward ports securely, useful in development and debugging.
    
4. **Remote Scripting**: Run scripts or commands on remote systems directly from your machine.
    
5. **Version Control Access**: Developers use SSH to interact with Git repositories (e.g., GitHub).
    

---

#### 🛠️ **Installation (if not already installed)**

```bash
# On the server
sudo yum install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl start sshd
sudo systemctl enable sshd

# On the client (usually already installed)
sudo yum install openssh-clients -y
```

---

#### 🔐 **Basic SSH Command Syntax**

```bash
ssh username@hostname_or_ip
```

✅ Example:

```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.10
```

You’ll be prompted for a password, and if correct, you get shell access.

---

#### 🛡️ **Security Tips**

* Use **key-based authentication** instead of passwords.
    
* Change the default SSH port (`22`) in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
    
* Disable root login over SSH for extra security.
    
* Use a firewall to limit SSH access to specific IP ranges.
    

---

#### 🧪 **Troubleshooting SSH**

* If SSH fails to connect, check:
    
    * `systemctl status sshd`
        
    * Port `22` is open (`firewalld`, `iptables`)
        
    * Correct IP or DNS name
        
    * User permissions and `~/.ssh` key permissions
        

---

#### 📁 **Configuration Files**

* Server config: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    
* Client config: `~/.ssh/config`
    

---

#### 💡 **Pro Tip: Key-Based Authentication**

```bash
# Generate SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa

# Copy public key to server
ssh-copy-id user@remote_host

# Now you can SSH without password!
ssh user@remote_host
```

---

### 🔍 Summary Table

| Feature | Telnet | SSH |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security | ❌ None (plain text) | ✅ Encrypted |
| Port | 23 | 22 |
| File Transfer | ❌ Not Supported | ✅ scp, sftp |
| Key Auth | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Use Case | Lab-only (testing) | Production, Cloud, DevOps, Security |

---

### 💡 Pro Tip:

Disable Telnet if it's not required:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable telnet.socket
sudo systemctl stop telnet.socket
```

## 🌐 DNS in Linux – Domain Name System Explained (Setup + Real Use Case)

### 📘 What is DNS?

DNS (Domain Name System) is the **phonebook of the internet**.  
Instead of remembering IP addresses like `192.168.1.100`, we use **hostnames** like `server.lab.local`. DNS helps us **translate names ↔ IPs**.

---

### 🧠 DNS Records You Should Know

| Record Type | Purpose | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Hostname → IP address | `web.lab.local → 192.168.1.100` |
| PTR | IP address → Hostname (Reverse Lookup) | `192.168.1.100 → web.lab.local` |
| CNAME | Alias/Canonical name | `www → web.lab.local` |

---

### 📁 DNS Configuration Files

| File/Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/named.conf` | Main DNS configuration file |
| `/var/named/` | Directory where zone files are stored |
| Zone Files | Forward & Reverse DNS lookups (e.g., `forward.lab`, `reverse.lab`) |

---

### 🔧 DNS Server Setup in a Lab (Real-World Style)

Imagine you're setting up internal DNS for a private network. You have 3 nodes:

* **Master DNS Server**: Handles primary zone
    
* **Slave DNS Server**: Acts as a backup
    
* **Client System**: Queries DNS
    

#### 🌐 Domain:

`lab.local`

#### 📍 Example IP:

`192.168.56.10` (on `enp0s3` interface)

---

### 📦 Step-by-Step DNS Setup (Using BIND)

#### 1️⃣ Install BIND and Utilities

```bash
sudo yum install bind bind-utils -y
```

#### 2️⃣ Modify `/etc/named.conf`

* Allow queries from your network
    
* Define your forward and reverse zones
    

```bash
listen-on port 53 { any; };
allow-query     { any; };

zone "lab.local" IN {
     type master;
     file "forward.lab";
};

zone "56.168.192.in-addr.arpa" IN {
     type master;
     file "reverse.lab";
};
```

#### 3️⃣ Create Zone Files in `/var/named/`

**forward.lab**

```bash
$TTL 86400
@   IN  SOA     dns.lab.local. root.lab.local. (
            2025042101 ; Serial
            3600       ; Refresh
            1800       ; Retry
            604800     ; Expire
            86400 )    ; Minimum TTL
@       IN  NS      dns.lab.local.
dns     IN  A       192.168.56.10
client1 IN  A       192.168.56.20
```

**reverse.lab**

```bash
$TTL 86400
@   IN  SOA     dns.lab.local. root.lab.local. (
            2025042101
            3600
            1800
            604800
            86400 )
@       IN  NS      dns.lab.local.
10      IN  PTR     dns.lab.local.
20      IN  PTR     client1.lab.local.
```

#### 4️⃣ Set Correct Permissions

```bash
chown root:named /var/named/forward.lab
chown root:named /var/named/reverse.lab
```

#### 5️⃣ Start the DNS Service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart named
sudo systemctl enable named
```

---

### 🧪 Test DNS from a Client Machine

Ensure `/etc/resolv.conf` contains:

```bash
nameserver 192.168.56.10
```

Then test:

```bash
dig client1.lab.local
nslookup client1.lab.local
dig -x 192.168.56.20
```

---

### 🧯 Snapshot Tip

🛑 **Take a VM snapshot before starting DNS configuration**  
🔁 Revert to the snapshot in case of config issues or rollbacks

---

### 💡 Real-World Use Cases

* Corporate IT uses internal DNS to **resolve private hostnames**
    
* DevOps teams manage **custom zones for staging/test environments**
    
* ISPs & hosting companies run **authoritative DNS servers**
    
* DNS is key in **Active Directory**, **email delivery**, **web hosting**, and more
    

---

### 🌐 **DNS Lookup in Linux – Using** `dig` and `nslookup`

---

#### 📘 **What is DNS Lookup?**

DNS (Domain Name System) is like the phonebook of the internet. DNS lookup is the process of translating a **hostname (like** [**google.com**](http://google.com)**)** into its **corresponding IP address (like 142.250.183.78)** — and vice versa.

You can perform these lookups using two powerful command-line tools:

* 🔍 `nslookup`
    
* 📡 `dig`
    

These tools help **test, troubleshoot, and analyze** DNS resolution issues.

---

### 🧰 1. `nslookup` – Quick & Simple DNS Lookup Tool

---

#### ✅ Basic Syntax:

```bash
nslookup [hostname]
```

#### ✅ Example:

```bash
nslookup google.com
```

**Output:**

```text
Server:         192.168.1.1
Address:        192.168.1.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   google.com
Address: 142.250.183.78
```

#### 🔄 Reverse Lookup:

```bash
nslookup 8.8.8.8
```

---

#### 🔧 Real-World Use Cases:

* Check if a domain is resolving properly.
    
* Test if your local DNS resolver is working.
    
* Verify PTR records (reverse DNS).
    
* Debug issues with internal DNS in enterprise networks.
    

---

### 🧠 2. `dig` – Detailed DNS Lookup & Analysis Tool

---

#### ✅ Basic Syntax:

```bash
dig [hostname]
```

#### ✅ Example:

```bash
dig example.com
```

**Key sections in the output:**

* `QUESTION SECTION`: What you queried.
    
* `ANSWER SECTION`: The IP addresses or CNAMEs resolved.
    
* `AUTHORITY SECTION`: The authoritative DNS servers.
    
* `ADDITIONAL SECTION`: Additional helpful DNS info.
    

---

#### 🔄 Reverse DNS Lookup:

```bash
dig -x 8.8.8.8
```

---

#### 🎯 Query Specific Record Types:

```bash
dig example.com A       # IPv4 address
dig example.com AAAA    # IPv6 address
dig example.com MX      # Mail server
dig example.com NS      # Name servers
dig example.com CNAME   # Canonical name
```

---

### 📊 Comparison: `dig` vs `nslookup`

| Feature | `nslookup` | `dig` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Output Simplicity | Short & readable | Verbose & detailed |
| Scripting Use | Less preferred | Ideal for scripts/parsing |
| Debugging | Basic DNS testing | Advanced diagnostics |
| Availability | Almost always available | May need install (bind-utils) |

---

### 🛠️ Installation (if missing)

```bash
sudo yum install bind-utils -y  # Includes both dig and nslookup
```

---

### 🧪 Troubleshooting Scenarios

1. ❌ Website not resolving? Use `dig` to see if DNS returns an IP.
    
2. 🧩 Email issues? Check `MX` records with `dig` [`domain.com`](http://domain.com) `MX`.
    
3. 🔍 DNS propagation? Use `dig @8.8.8.8` [`domain.com`](http://domain.com) to test against public DNS.
    
4. 🔁 Loopback on reverse lookup? Use `dig -x <ip>` to verify PTR records.
    

---

### 💡 Bonus: Use Public DNS Servers

```bash
dig google.com @8.8.8.8
```

👆 This uses Google's public DNS server directly, bypassing your system's default DNS.

---

Great choice! Let’s now break down **NTP** and **chronyd** — two key tools for **time synchronization** in Linux systems — with full explanations, syntax, real-world use cases, and troubleshooting tips.

---

## 🕒 NTP vs Chronyd – Time Synchronization in Linux

---

### 📌 Why is Time Synchronization Important?

* Accurate logs for troubleshooting & auditing.
    
* Time-based jobs (like cron) must run on schedule.
    
* Secure communication (SSL/TLS, Kerberos) depends on synchronized clocks.
    
* Distributed systems (like Kubernetes, databases, CI/CD pipelines) need aligned timestamps.
    

---

## ⏰ Part 1: NTP (Network Time Protocol)

---

### 🔧 What is NTP?

NTP is a protocol used to **synchronize the system time with NTP servers** (called time sources or stratum servers).

---

### 📦 Package:

```bash
yum install ntp -y
```

---

### 📂 Configuration File:

```bash
/etc/ntp.conf
```

This file lists trusted NTP servers:

```bash
server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 1.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
```

---

### 🔧 NTP Commands:

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Start the service | `systemctl start ntpd` |
| Enable at boot | `systemctl enable ntpd` |
| Check time peers | `ntpq -p` |
| Restart NTP | `systemctl restart ntpd` |

---

### 🧪 Real-World Example:

**Sync your server with NTP pool servers:**

```bash
yum install ntp -y
systemctl enable ntpd --now
ntpq -p
```

**Output:**

```text
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
==============================================================================
*time.server.com  .GPS.            1 u   19   64  377    0.568   -0.102   0.005
```

---

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting NTP

* **Ports required**: UDP 123 (ensure it’s open on firewall).
    
* If time is not syncing:
    
    * Check for typo in `/etc/ntp.conf`
        
    * Confirm network connectivity to NTP servers
        
    * Use `ntpdate` once for a manual sync:
        
        ```bash
        ntpdate pool.ntp.org
        ```
        

---

## ⚡ Part 2: `chronyd` – Faster, Modern Alternative to NTP

---

### 📌 Why `chronyd`?

* Designed for **faster and more accurate synchronization**.
    
* Handles **intermittent network** connections better.
    
* Preferred on modern systems (RHEL/CentOS 7+).
    

---

### 📦 Package:

```bash
yum install chrony -y
```

---

### 📂 Key Files:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/chrony.conf` | Main configuration |
| `/var/log/chrony/` | Log directory |
| `/run/chrony/` | Runtime data |

---

### 🧾 Sample `/etc/chrony.conf`

```text
server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
server 1.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst
driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift
allow 192.168.0.0/16
```

---

### 🚀 Commands:

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Start the service | `systemctl start chronyd` |
| Enable on boot | `systemctl enable chronyd` |
| Check sync status | `chronyc tracking` |
| Show servers | `chronyc sources` |
| Force sync | `chronyc makestep` |

---

### ✅ Real-World Example:

```bash
yum install chrony -y
systemctl enable chronyd --now
chronyc tracking
```

**Output:**

```text
Reference ID    : 85.199.214.101 (ntp2.brunel.ac.uk)
Stratum         : 2
Last offset     : -0.000263705 seconds
RMS offset      : 0.000303012 seconds
Frequency       : 3.812 ppm fast
```

---

### 🆚 NTP vs Chronyd – Quick Comparison

| Feature | NTP (`ntpd`) | Chronyd |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speed of sync | Slower | Faster |
| Preferred on RHEL/CentOS 7+ | Deprecated | ✅ Default choice |
| Better for mobile/laptop | ❌ | ✅ |
| Handles drift well | ❌ | ✅ |
| Manual correction | `ntpdate` | `chronyc makestep` |

---

### ⚠️ Troubleshooting Chrony:

* Check NTP server config in `/etc/chrony.conf`
    
* Use `chronyc tracking` to verify sync
    
* Ensure port UDP 123 is allowed in the firewall
    

---

## 🕹️ `timedatectl` – Modern Time Control Utility in Linux

---

### 📌 What is `timedatectl`?

`timedatectl` is a system utility introduced with `systemd` (available in RHEL/CentOS 7 and above) used to:

* View and set system date and time
    
* Manage time zones
    
* Enable or disable automatic time synchronization
    
* Interface with `chronyd`, `ntpd`, or `systemd-timesyncd`
    

---

### 🛠️ Why Use `timedatectl`?

* It's a **central control tool** for time-related settings.
    
* Works with both **NTP (ntpd)** and **Chrony**.
    
* Replaces older `date` command for setting time.
    

---

### 🔧 Basic Syntax:

```bash
timedatectl [options]
```

---

### 📚 Key Commands & Use Cases

| Task | Command | Example / Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ View current time settings | `timedatectl` | Shows local time, UTC, NTP status, time zone |
| 🗺️ List all time zones | `timedatectl list-timezones` | Use arrow keys to browse |
| 🌍 Set time zone | `timedatectl set-timezone Region/City` | `timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kolkata` |
| 📅 Set system date | `timedatectl set-time YYYY-MM-DD` | `timedatectl set-time 2025-04-21` |
| ⌚ Set full date + time | `timedatectl set-time 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'` | `timedatectl set-time '2025-04-21 14:30:00'` |
| 🔄 Enable NTP sync | `timedatectl set-ntp true` | Automatically sync time via NTP |
| ❌ Disable NTP | `timedatectl set-ntp false` | Use this to manually set time |

---

### 💡 Real-World Example

#### 💻 Scenario: Configure your server in a different timezone (e.g., New York), and sync time using Chrony.

```bash
timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York
timedatectl set-ntp true
timedatectl
```

**Sample Output:**

```text
               Local time: Mon 2025-04-21 04:35:21 EDT
           Universal time: Mon 2025-04-21 08:35:21 UTC
                 RTC time: Mon 2025-04-21 08:35:20
                Time zone: America/New_York (EDT, -0400)
System clock synchronized: yes
              NTP service: active
          RTC in local TZ: no
```

---

### ⚙️ Integration With Other Tools

* Works seamlessly with `chronyd` or `ntpd`.
    
* You must have either **Chrony or NTP configured** for `set-ntp true` to work.
    

---

### 💬 Note on `systemd-timesyncd`

* Lightweight alternative to `chronyd`/`ntpd`.
    
* Comes with Debian/Ubuntu by default.
    
* **Not included in RHEL/CentOS standard repos.**
    
* Can be manually installed and managed via `timedatectl`.
    

---

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips

| Symptom | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| `System clock synchronized: no` | Ensure `chronyd` or `ntpd` is running |
| Time doesn’t update | Use `chronyc tracking` or `ntpq -p` to verify server sync |
| Time zone not changing | Double-check correct format (`Region/City`) |
| NTP fails to enable | Check `/etc/chrony.conf` or `/etc/ntp.conf` for correct server config |

---

### 📌 Summary: When to Use What?

| Tool | Use For |
| --- | --- |
| `timedatectl` | Central management of date, time, NTP, and timezone |
| `chronyd` / `ntpd` | Core time sync with internet or LAN NTP servers |
| `chronyc` / `ntpq` | Debugging and querying time sync details |

---

## 📬 **Sendmail – Sending Emails from Your Linux System**

---

### 📌 What is Sendmail?

**Sendmail** is a **mail transfer agent (MTA)** used on Unix-like systems to **send, receive, and route email**.

It operates using the **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**, typically over **port 25**.

> ✅ Ideal for server notifications, log emails, or automating alerts.

---

### 🎯 Use Cases

* Send backup logs to system administrators.
    
* Automate alerts from scripts or cron jobs.
    
* Receive application or system messages (e.g., failed services).
    

---

### 🧱 How Sendmail Works

1. A user or script generates an email.
    
2. Sendmail uses **SMTP** to route the email.
    
3. If the recipient isn’t reachable, it queues the message and retries later.
    
4. Can be used **locally** or configured to send mail **externally** (via relay or mail server).
    

---

### 🧰 Installation and Setup

#### ✅ Step 1: Install Sendmail and Configuration Files

```bash
sudo yum install sendmail sendmail-cf -y
```

#### ✅ Step 2: Check if Sendmail is Installed

```bash
rpm -qa | grep sendmail
```

#### ✅ Step 3: Configure (Optional Advanced Step)

Edit the main configuration macro file:

```bash
vi /etc/mail/sendmail.mc
```

Make changes (e.g., to allow external relaying), then generate [`sendmail.cf`](http://sendmail.cf):

```bash
m4 /etc/mail/sendmail.mc > /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
```

#### ✅ Step 4: Start and Enable the Service

```bash
systemctl start sendmail
systemctl enable sendmail
```

#### ✅ Step 5: Disable Firewall for Testing (Not for production!)

```bash
systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl disable firewalld
```

---

### 📬 Sending an Email via Terminal

```bash
echo "This is the email body" | mail -s "Test Subject" you@example.com
```

> `-s`: [Subject  
> ](mailto:Subject￼you@example.com)***you@example.com***: Destination email  
> You can also CC, BCC, and include attachments with more advanced tools like `mailx`.

---

### 📁 Important Sendmail Files and Directories

| File/Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/mail/`[`sendmail.cf`](http://sendmail.cf) | Main configuration file (compiled) |
| `/etc/mail/`[`sendmail.mc`](http://sendmail.mc) | Editable macro configuration file |
| `/etc/mail/` | Directory with configs like aliases, relay-domains, etc. |
| `/var/spool/mqueue` | Queue directory for unsent messages |
| `/var/log/maillog` | Log file for sent/failed email details |

---

### 🛠️ Real-World Example: Send System Log File via Email

```bash
cat /var/log/messages | mail -s "Syslog for $(hostname)" admin@yourdomain.com
```

Or use a script in a cron job:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
tail -50 /var/log/secure | mail -s "Security Logs for $(hostname)" admin@yourdomain.com
```

---

### ⚠️ Common Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Emails not sending | Check `/var/log/maillog` |
| Cannot resolve domain | Ensure DNS is working and `/etc/resolv.conf` is set |
| Port 25 blocked | Check firewall or cloud provider rules |
| Too complex config | Use `mailx` or `ssmtp` for simpler setups |

---

### 📌 Summary

| Feature | Value |

### 🖥️ Testing Your Setup

1. Start the service: `systemctl start httpd`
    
2. Open a browser and go to:
    
    ```bash
    http://<your-server-ip>/
    ```
    
3. If you see the Apache test page, it's working!
    
4. You can now place your custom website files inside:
    
    ```bash
    /var/www/html/
    ```
    

---

### 📝 Create a Simple Web Page

```bash
echo "Welcome to Apache on $(hostname)" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

Visit your server IP in a browser to see the result.

---

### 🔒 Allowing HTTP/HTTPS through Firewall

```bash
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

### 🛠️ Real-World Example: Host Internal Tools

Let’s say you have a script that generates system status reports. You can output them as an HTML file:

```bash
uptime > /var/www/html/status.html
```

Now access it via browser:

```bash
http://your-ip/status.html
```

Great for simple internal dashboards!

## 📘 **Rsyslog – The Logging Backbone of Linux**

---

### 🚀 What is `rsyslog`?

`rsyslog` stands for **Rocket-fast System for Log processing**.

It is the **default logging daemon** in most modern Linux distributions (RHEL/CentOS 6+ and 7/8/9), responsible for:

* Collecting logs
    
* Formatting and filtering logs
    
* Storing logs locally
    
* Forwarding logs to remote servers (centralized logging)
    
* Supporting various log sources (system, kernel, applications)
    

> Think of it as the **event pipeline** of your Linux system.

---

### 📦 Install & Manage Rsyslog

In most systems, it's already installed and running. But to check:

```bash
rpm -qa | grep rsyslog
sudo yum install rsyslog -y  # If not installed
```

Start and enable the service:

```bash
systemctl start rsyslog
systemctl enable rsyslog
```

---

### 🧠 How It Works – The Architecture

```bash
+---------------------+
| System Components   |
| (kernel, apps, etc) |
+---------------------+
          |
          v
   /dev/log socket OR journald
          |
          v
     +-----------+
     | rsyslogd  |  <--- main daemon
     +-----------+
          |
          v
  +----------------------------+
  | Filter → Action (rule set) |
  +----------------------------+
```

> Filters decide *what* to do with logs.  
> Actions decide *where* to send/store them.

---

### 🗂️ Main Configuration Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/rsyslog.conf` | Main configuration file |
| `/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf` | Drop-in custom rules (modular) |
| `/var/log/` | Default log storage directory |
| `/var/log/messages` | Generic logs |
| `/var/log/secure` | Auth-related logs |
| `/var/log/maillog` | Mail logs |
| `/var/log/cron` | Cron job logs |

---

### 🛠️ Syntax in `/etc/rsyslog.conf`

```bash
FACILITY.PRIORITY    ACTION
```

#### 🔸 Example:

```bash
authpriv.*     /var/log/secure
*.info         /var/log/messages
cron.*         /var/log/cron
```

* **Facility**: part of the system (auth, cron, kernel, etc.)
    
* **Priority**: severity (debug, info, warn, err, crit, alert)
    
* **Action**: what to do (save to file, forward to remote, run a script)
    

---

### 🛰️ Sending Logs to a Central Rsyslog Server

#### 📍 **Client Side Setup**

1. Edit `/etc/rsyslog.conf` or drop-in file in `/etc/rsyslog.d/`
    

```bash
*.* @@192.168.1.100:514   # TCP
*.* @192.168.1.100:514    # UDP
```

2. Restart rsyslog:
    

```bash
systemctl restart rsyslog
```

> Make sure port **514** is open on both sides.

---

#### 🖥️ **Server Side Setup**

1. Edit `/etc/rsyslog.conf`:
    

```bash
module(load="imudp")       # For UDP
input(type="imudp" port="514")

module(load="imtcp")       # For TCP
input(type="imtcp" port="514")
```

2. Restart rsyslog and open firewall ports:
    

```bash
systemctl restart rsyslog
firewall-cmd --add-port=514/udp --permanent
firewall-cmd --add-port=514/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

### 📍 Real-World Use Case: Centralized Logging for Multiple Servers

**Scenario**: You're managing 10+ servers. You want all logs to be forwarded to a single log analyzer like ELK, Graylog, or a central rsyslog server.

Steps:

1. Set up a central rsyslog server with inputs on TCP/UDP 514.
    
2. Configure each Linux host to forward logs to the central server.
    
3. Optionally use `logrotate` to manage log size.
    
4. Feed logs into ELK stack or scripts for alerting, auditing, or anomaly detection.
    

---

### 🧪 Sample: Logging SSH Attempts to a Custom File

Add this to `/etc/rsyslog.d/ssh.conf`:

```bash
:programname, isequal, "sshd" /var/log/ssh_attempts.log
& stop
```

Restart the daemon:

```bash
systemctl restart rsyslog
```

Now you’ll see SSH logs separately.

---

### 📦 Log Rotation Support

Rsyslog works hand-in-hand with `logrotate` to manage log file size, backups, and archiving.

```bash
cat /etc/logrotate.d/syslog
```

Example config:

```bash
/var/log/messages {
    weekly
    rotate 4
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
    notifempty
    postrotate
        /bin/kill -HUP `cat /var/run/rsyslogd.pid`
    endscript
}
```

---

### 🧩 Extra Tips for Sysadmins

* Always monitor `/var/log/messages` and `/var/log/secure`
    
* Use `grep`, `tail -f`, and `less` to analyze logs in real time
    
* Use `rsyslog` with **log forwarding + alerting tools** like `swatch`, `Logwatch`, or **ELK**
    
* Automate log cleanup with `logrotate`
    
* Use tagging to separate logs from different servers when centralizing
