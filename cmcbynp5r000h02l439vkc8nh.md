> **Welcome to the Linux Practical Series**  
> This blog series is 100% task-based ‚Äî no theory, no fluff. Whether you're a beginner or working your way toward advanced Linux skills, this series is designed to **make you learn by doing**.

Each chapter includes a **real-world scenario** followed by **step-by-step tasks** that you must complete on a Linux machine. As you progress, you‚Äôll move from basic user commands to advanced sysadmin-level tasks.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Task Scenario

You‚Äôve completed your initial Linux training. Now it‚Äôs time to start working with a real system. You‚Äôve received your **new user account**, and you're ready to begin!

## ‚úÖ Tasks to Perform

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Login and Basic Verification

* Login using your newly created user account.
    
* Identify where you are in the system.
    
* Verify which user you are logged in as.
    

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Explore Your System ‚Äì Collect System Information

Find and make note of the following details about the system you‚Äôve logged into:

* Hostname of the machine
    
* Number of currently logged-in users
    
* System uptime
    
* Linux version and kernel information
    
* Filesystem details and usage
    
* Total and available memory
    
* CPU and number of cores
    
* Swap memory status
    
* IP address of the machine
    

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Your Website Directory Structure

You're planning to host a website locally for learning purposes. Begin preparing your workspace:

* Create a parent directory for your website named **MyWebsite**.
    
* Inside `MyWebsite`, create the following subdirectories:
    
    * `Docs`
        
    * `Scripts`
        
    * `Logs`
        

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Organize Project Files

Inside the `Docs` directory:

* Create a file named **README.txt**
    
    * Add a welcome message to this file.
        
* Create another file named **project\_notes.txt**
    
    * Write down all the activities you performed today (Day 1 notes).
        

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ File Movement and Organization

* Move the file `project_notes.txt` to the `Scripts` directory and rename it appropriately.
    
* Move the `README.txt` file to the `Logs` directory.
    
* List all files and directories under `MyWebsite` and verify your structure.
    

### üÜò Use Help if Needed

If you're unsure about any command or its usage, use built-in Linux help tools such as:

* Manual pages
    
* Help flags
    
* Command lookup utilities
    

### üß™ Final Task ‚Äì Script Your Work

Once all tasks are complete:

* Create a script file that contains all the commands you executed.
    
* Run the script on your system to verify it completes all tasks automatically.
    

### üìå Note:

Do not just copy commands from the internet. Try recalling and using the right command yourself. Use help when you're stuck. This is how real learning happens!

## üìù **Summary ‚Äì Explore and Set Up Your Linux Environment**

In this chapter, you kicked off your practical Linux journey by performing essential tasks on a live system. You started by logging in with your user account, verifying your session, and gathering key system information like hostname, uptime, memory, CPU, IP address, and disk usage.

You then began setting up your first hands-on project: a basic website directory structure. You created folders, added files with meaningful content, organized them into appropriate directories, and finally scripted your entire process for automation and reusability.

This chapter laid the groundwork for building confidence in Linux commands, understanding the environment you're working in, and following structured task flows ‚Äî just like a real system administrator would.
