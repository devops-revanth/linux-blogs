## 🔥 Linux Firewall Configuration – Part 1: `iptables` (Legacy Firewall in RHEL/CentOS 6)

## 🔍 Why Firewall Configuration Matters

In the Linux ecosystem, firewalls play a vital role in protecting the system from unauthorized access, intrusion attempts, and malicious network traffic. Before the rise of `firewalld`, `iptables` was the de facto tool used in RHEL and CentOS 6 (and earlier).

**Why learn** `iptables` today?

* Legacy systems (still in production in many enterprises) run RHEL/CentOS 6.
    
* Many Linux certifications (RHCE, CompTIA Linux+, etc.) test foundational knowledge of `iptables`.
    
* Helps in understanding the transition from static to dynamic firewalls.
    

## 🧠 What Is `iptables`?

`iptables` is a command-line utility that uses **Netfilter** (kernel-level packet filtering framework) to configure rules for network traffic filtering. It inspects each packet that comes into, goes out of, or passes through the system and takes an action: **ACCEPT**, **DROP**, or **REJECT**.

### ✳️ Key Concepts:

* **Chains**: Group of rules applied to packets (`INPUT`, `OUTPUT`, `FORWARD`).
    
* **Tables**: Types of rules (`filter`, `nat`, `mangle`, `raw`).
    
* **Targets**: What to do with a matching packet (`ACCEPT`, `DROP`, `REJECT`, `LOG`).
    

---

## 🛠️ How To Use `iptables` – Commands and Examples

### 📌 Check Current Rules

```bash
iptables -L -n -v
```

* `-L`: List rules
    
* `-n`: Don’t resolve names
    
* `-v`: Verbose output
    

### 🔧 Basic Rule Structure

```bash
iptables -A <CHAIN> -p <protocol> --dport <port> -j <TARGET>
```

#### Example: Allow SSH (port 22)

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

#### Example: Drop all other traffic

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
```

### 🔁 Flush All Rules

```bash
iptables -F
```

Use with caution — this removes all active firewall rules.

## 🔒 Common Real-World Use Cases

### ✅ Allow Specific Services (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS)

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT   # HTTP
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT  # HTTPS
```

### 🛡️ Drop Ping Requests

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP
```

### 🔎 Log Dropped Packets

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "IPTables-Dropped: " --log-level 4
```

## 💾 Save & Persist Rules

In RHEL/CentOS 6, `iptables` rules are **not persistent by default**. To save rules:

```bash
service iptables save
```

Rules are stored in `/etc/sysconfig/iptables`

### Restart iptables service

```bash
service iptables restart
```

## 🧰 Advanced Tips

### 💡 Use the `-I` Option to Insert Rules at the Top

```bash
iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

### 🔄 Block a Specific IP

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.100 -j DROP
```

---

## 📌 Summary

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| List rules | `iptables -L -n -v` |
| Allow SSH | `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT` |
| Drop traffic | `iptables -A INPUT -j DROP` |
| Save rules | `service iptables save` |
| Flush rules | `iptables -F` |

## 📘 Conclusion

Although `iptables` has been replaced by `firewalld` in newer RHEL versions, it's crucial for sysadmins to grasp its usage—especially when maintaining legacy systems or working in mixed-version environments. In the next part, we’ll dive into the dynamic and zone-based world of `firewalld`.

## 🔥 Linux Firewall Configuration – Part 2: `firewalld` (Dynamic Firewall in RHEL 7/8/9)

## 🔍 Why `firewalld`?

RHEL 7 introduced `firewalld` as a replacement for the older static `iptables` system. It provides **dynamic, zone-based firewall management**, and integrates better with modern services and network interfaces. Unlike `iptables`, which requires full reloads to apply rule changes, `firewalld` allows **runtime updates** without disrupting existing connections.

### 🔑 Why `firewalld` matters:

* Dynamically applies rules without disconnecting active sessions.
    
* Simplifies firewall management with **zones** and **services**.
    
* Plays nicely with **NetworkManager** and **Cockpit** (GUI admin).
    
* Default firewall for **RHEL 7, 8, and 9**.
    

---

## 🧠 What is `firewalld`?

`firewalld` is a daemon that manages firewall rules dynamically using **zones**, **services**, **interfaces**, and **rules**. It's built on top of **nftables** (or `iptables` as backend in RHEL 7) and uses **DBus** for control.

### 🔥 Key Concepts:

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Zones** | Group of rules applied to a network interface (e.g., `public`, `home`, `internal`) |
| **Services** | Predefined rule sets for services like SSH, HTTP, etc. |
| **Permanent vs Runtime** | Rules can be set temporarily (runtime) or persistently (permanent) |
| **Interfaces** | Network interfaces assigned to zones (e.g., `eth0 → public`) |

---

## 🛠️ How to Use `firewalld` – Commands & Examples

### ✅ Start and Enable `firewalld`

```bash
systemctl start firewalld
systemctl enable firewalld
```

---

### 🔍 Check Status and Default Zone

```bash
firewall-cmd --state
firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
```

---

### 🧾 View All Active Rules

```bash
firewall-cmd --list-all
```

Or for a specific zone:

```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
```

---

## 🔧 Common Tasks with Examples

### ✅ Allow Services

#### Example: Allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS

```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=ssh --permanent
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=https --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

### ✅ Open a Custom Port

```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

### 🔒 Remove a Service or Port

```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-service=ssh --permanent
firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=8080/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

### 🔄 Assign Interface to a Zone

```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=home --change-interface=eth0 --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

## 🔁 Runtime vs Permanent Rules

* **Runtime** changes take effect immediately but disappear on reboot.
    
* **Permanent** changes require `--permanent` flag and a `--reload`.
    

### Temporary (runtime only)

```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=ftp
```

### Make it persistent

```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=ftp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

## 🛡️ Real-World Use Cases

### 📌 Secure a Web Server

```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=https --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

### 🕳️ Allow Access to a Custom Application (e.g., App on Port 9000)

```bash
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9000/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

### 🚫 Block Access from a Specific IP (using rich rules)

```bash
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address=192.168.0.100 reject'
firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

## 🔧 Tune System Performance in Linux

Linux systems come reasonably optimized by default, but depending on your environment—whether it’s a high-throughput server, a desktop, or a VM—you can significantly **enhance performance** by applying system tuning strategies.

This guide covers:

* Selecting performance tuning profiles using the `tuned` daemon
    
* Managing **process priority** using `nice` and `renice`
    
* Real-world examples and Cockpit (web UI) integration
    

## 🧠 Why Tune System Performance?

Linux handles most tasks efficiently out-of-the-box, but different workloads (database, virtual host, gaming, high I/O, etc.) can benefit from specialized configurations. Tuning allows you to:

* Reduce latency
    
* Improve throughput
    
* Prioritize important services
    
* Optimize system resource usage
    

## ⚙️ What is `tuned`?

`Tuned` (pronounced "tune-d") is a **system tuning daemon** that dynamically adjusts system settings based on predefined **profiles**. It optimizes CPU, disk I/O, network throughput, and power management.

### Key Features:

* Systemd-managed service (`tuned.service`)
    
* Comes **pre-installed** in RHEL/CentOS 7/8/9
    
* Uses tuning **profiles** tailored for specific workloads
    
* Automatically adjusts system performance at runtime
    

### 🧰 Package and Service Info:

```bash
# Check if tuned is installed
rpm -qa | grep tuned

# Install if needed
sudo yum install tuned

# Start and enable the service
sudo systemctl start tuned
sudo systemctl enable tuned

# Check status
systemctl status tuned
```

## 📋 Tuned Profiles and Their Use Cases

| Profile | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `balanced` | Default profile – balanced between performance and power saving |
| `desktop` | Improved responsiveness for desktop environments |
| `throughput-performance` | High throughput for network or disk-heavy operations |
| `latency-performance` | Reduces latency for time-sensitive workloads |
| `network-latency` | Optimized for minimal network latency |
| `network-throughput` | Maximized for network bandwidth |
| `powersave` | Reduces power usage (laptops/low-load systems) |
| `oracle` | Optimized for Oracle DB performance |
| `virtual-guest` | Tuned for VMs (KVM, etc.) |
| `virtual-host` | Best for hypervisor/VM hosts |

## 🔧 How to Use Tuned

### 🔍 View Current Active Profile:

```bash
tuned-adm active
```

### 📜 List All Available Profiles:

```bash
tuned-adm list
```

### ✅ Apply a New Profile:

```bash
sudo tuned-adm profile profile-name
# Example:
sudo tuned-adm profile throughput-performance
```

### 💡 Get Profile Recommendation:

```bash
tuned-adm recommend
```

### ❌ Disable Tuned:

```bash
sudo tuned-adm off
```

## 🌐 Using Cockpit to Manage Tuned

If you're using **Cockpit Web Console**, you can manage tuning profiles via a GUI:

1. Login: `https://<your-server-ip>:9090`
    
2. Navigate to:  
    **Overview → Configuration → Performance Profile**
    
3. Select and apply your desired profile
    

This is a great method for admins who prefer visual tools over command line.

## 🎯 Prioritizing Processes: nice & renice

Even with system-wide tuning, you may need to **boost or lower priority** of specific processes.

### 🧠 Understanding Nice Values:

* Ranges from **\-20 (highest priority)** to **19 (lowest priority)**
    
* Default nice level is `0`
    
* Used to influence scheduling of CPU time
    

### 🖥️ Check Current Priorities:

```bash
top
# Or use ps for a focused view
ps axo pid,comm,nice,cls --sort=-nice
```

### 🏷️ Set Priority While Launching a Process:

```bash
nice -n <value> <command>
# Example:
nice -n -10 top
```

### ♻️ Change Priority of Running Process:

```bash
renice -n <value> <PID>
# Example:
renice -n 12 1234
```

### 🧬 Kernel Priority Classes:

* `Nice` is a **user-space value**
    
* Kernel uses **PR (Process Priority)** ranging:
    
    * **0–99** → Real-time
        
    * **100–139** → Normal user-space processes
        

## 📌 Real-World Use Cases

* ✅ Apply `latency-performance` on a low-latency VoIP server
    
* ✅ Use `virtual-guest` inside KVM virtual machines
    
* ✅ Give higher priority to a database process with `nice -n -5 mysqld`
    
* ✅ Optimize power usage on laptops with `powersave` profile
    

---

## ✅ Summary

Tuning your Linux system isn't just for advanced sysadmins. With `tuned` and tools like `nice`, anyone can make smart, efficient adjustments to improve performance.

Whether you're running a high-traffic web server, optimizing VM guests, or just want your system to be snappier—**tuning gives you control**.
