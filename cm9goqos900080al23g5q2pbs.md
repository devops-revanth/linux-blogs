In our previous chapter, we explored the powerful text processing commands like `cut`, `awk`, and `grep`. Now, it's time to go one level deeper into essential tools and tricks that help in working with files more efficiently—especially when scripting or handling automation tasks.

In this chapter, we’ll cover:

* How to **compress** and **uncompress** files
    
* Use of `truncate` to shrink or extend files
    
* How to **combine** and **split** large files
    
* Executing **multiple commands** in one go using `;`
    
* Revisiting the `vi` editor with more hands-on usage
    
* A quick dive into `vim` vs `vi`
    
* A glimpse of `sed`, one of the most powerful stream editors
    

Let's power up this chapter with the **modern and real-world tools** for compression! While `compress` and `uncompress` are classic, nowadays `tar`, `gzip`, and `gunzip` are more commonly used — especially in DevOps and server-side work.

So here we go! 🧠💥

## 🎯 File Compression in Linux Using `tar`, `gzip`, and `gunzip`

Compressing files helps save space, transfer faster over the network, and bundle multiple files into one archive for backups or packaging.

Let’s break it down step by step 👇

### 📦 1. `tar` — Archive Without Compression

#### 📌 What is `tar`?

`tar` (tape archive) bundles multiple files/directories into a **single archive file** with a `.tar` extension — no compression by default.

#### ⚙️ Syntax:

```bash
tar -cvf archive.tar file1 file2 dir/
```

* `-c`: create a new archive
    
* `-v`: verbose (shows progress)
    
* `-f`: filename for the archive
    

#### ✅ Example:

```bash
tar -cvf project_backup.tar file1.txt file2.txt dir1/
```

🟢 **Output:**

```bash
bashCopyEditfile1.txt
file2.txt
dir1/
```

Creates: `project_backup.tar`

### 🗜️ 2. `gzip` — Compress Files (and `.tar` files)

#### 📌 What is `gzip`?

`gzip` compresses files using the GNU zip format. It is commonly used **with tar** to compress `.tar` files into `.tar.gz`.

#### ⚙️ Syntax:

```bash
gzip filename
```

🧠 Use `gzip -d` or `gunzip` to decompress.

#### ✅ Example 1: Compress a single file

```bash
gzip file1.txt
```

🟢 Output:

```bash
file1.txt.gz
```

Original `file1.txt` is removed (you can keep it using `-c`).

#### ✅ Example 2: Compress a tarball (tar + gzip)

```bash
tar -czvf backup.tar.gz file1.txt dir/
```

* `-z`: compress with gzip
    
* `-c`: create
    
* `-v`: verbose
    
* `-f`: filename
    

🟢 Output:

```bash
backup.tar.gz
```

### 🔓 3. `gunzip` / `gzip -d` — Decompress `.gz` Files

#### Syntax:

```bash
gunzip filename.gz
```

or

```bash
gzip -d filename.gz
```

#### ✅ Example:

```bash
gunzip file1.txt.gz
```

🟢 Result: restores `file1.txt`

### 📁 4. Extract a `.tar.gz` Archive

```bash
tar -xzvf backup.tar.gz
```

* `-x`: extract
    
* `-z`: use gzip
    
* `-v`: verbose
    
* `-f`: file name
    

🟢 Output: Files/folders inside the archive get extracted in current dir.

### 🔥 Real-World Use Cases

#### 💼 Backup Project Files with Compression

```bash
tar -czvf project_2024.tar.gz /home/user/project/
```

Use this for scheduled backups or to upload zipped projects to cloud.

#### 🚚 Transfer Logs with Reduced Size

```bash
gzip access.log
scp access.log.gz user@server:/logs/
```

Fast transfer + less bandwidth usage 💡

#### 📤 Combine, Compress, Send (DevOps Style)

```bash
tar -czvf logs.tar.gz /var/log/*.log
scp logs.tar.gz user@remote:/backup/logs/
```

Super handy in automation scripts or cronjobs.

### ✅ Final Tip

If you just want to **see what's inside** a `.tar.gz` file without extracting:

```bash
tar -tzvf backup.tar.gz
```

Let’s now explore the ✂️ `truncate` command — simple but powerful, especially when dealing with **log files**, **test data**, or space management.

## ✂️ `truncate` Command in Linux

### 📌 What is `truncate`?

The `truncate` command is used to **shrink or extend the size of a file** to a specified size.  
It’s like saying: "I only want this file to be *this big*, cut the rest or fill it."

---

### ⚙️ Syntax:

```bash
truncate -s [size] filename
```

* `-s`: size you want to set for the file.
    
    * `+` / `-` can be used to increase or decrease.
        
    * `K`, `M`, `G` can be used for kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes.
        

### ✅ Example 1: Create and truncate a new file

```bash
truncate -s 5K file1.txt
```

🟢 Output:

```bash
ls -lh file1.txt
# -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 5.0K Apr 14 22:00 file1.txt
```

💡 File is created with 5 KB size (filled with null bytes).

### ✅ Example 2: Shrink an existing file

```bash
truncate -s 0 log.txt
```

📁 `log.txt` is now **emptied** but **not deleted** — great for rotating logs.

### ✅ Example 3: Reduce a file by 1KB

```bash
truncate -s -1K bigfile.log
```

💡 Very useful when trying to chop off unnecessary logs at the end.

### 🔥 Real-World Use Cases

#### 🧹 Clear log files without deleting

```bash
truncate -s 0 /var/log/syslog
```

🔐 Safer than `rm`, especially in scripts.

#### 🧪 Create dummy files of specific size (testing upload, disk space, etc.)

```bash
truncate -s 50M dummy.img
```

Used in performance testing, backup, storage automation, etc.

### 💡 Pro Tip:

You can also **extend** a file:

```bash
truncate -s +10K existing_file.txt
```

Adds 10KB of **null bytes** at the end.

Let’s dive into 🧩 **Combining and Splitting files in Linux** — real lifesavers when working with large datasets, backup chunks, or when transferring files.

## 🔀 **Combining Files**

The easiest way to combine files in Linux is by using `cat`.

### ✅ Example 1: Combine multiple text files into one

```bash
cat part1.txt part2.txt part3.txt > fullfile.txt
```

📌 This merges `part1.txt`, `part2.txt`, and `part3.txt` into a new file called `fullfile.txt`.

### ✅ Example 2: Append files one after another

```bash
cat notes1.txt >> master_notes.txt
cat notes2.txt >> master_notes.txt
```

This keeps appending to `master_notes.txt`.

### 🔥 Real Use Case – Combining logs

Imagine you archived logs per day like:

```bash
log-2025-04-12.log  
log-2025-04-13.log  
log-2025-04-14.log
```

Combine into a weekly log:

```bash
cat log-2025-04-*.log > weekly-report.log
```

## ✂️ **Splitting Files**

When files are too big to send or store as one chunk, we **split** them.

### 📦 `split` Command

### 🔧 Syntax:

```bash
split [options] bigfile prefix
```

### ✅ Example 1: Split by size (100MB chunks)

```bash
split -b 100M bigbackup.tar.gz backup_
```

🟢 Output:

```bash
backup_aa  
backup_ab  
backup_ac ...
```

### ✅ Example 2: Split by number of lines (every 1000 lines)

```bash
split -l 1000 bigfile.csv chunk_
```

### 🔁 Combine Again

```bash
cat backup_* > bigbackup.tar.gz
```

Make sure they’re in order (prefix naming ensures that).

### 🔥 Real Use Cases

* Splitting big `.tar.gz` archives before transferring over FTP.
    
* Chunking large CSVs for processing with limited memory.
    
* Breaking logs into parts to analyze separately.
    

🎯 **Bonus**: Use `zip` with `--split-size` for similar behavior with compression:

```bash
zip --split-size 100m -r project.zip project/
```

# 🔁 Executing Multiple Commands in One Line in Linux

Whether you're debugging, scripting, or just trying to be ultra-efficient on the terminal — chaining commands is an essential Linux skill. Let’s explore the real power of command chaining using `;`, `&&`, `||`, and how to combine them for smart logic 🧠

### 🧱 1. Using `;` – Run All Commands Sequentially (Regardless of Success or Failure)

🔧 **Syntax:**

```bash
command1 ; command2 ; command3
```

🧪 **What it does:**  
Runs all the commands in sequence — **even if one of them fails.**

✅ **Example:**

```bash
echo "Cleaning..." ; rm -rf temp/ ; echo "Done!"
```

🖥️ **Output:**

```bash
Cleaning...
Done!
```

Even if `rm -rf temp/` fails (e.g., if `temp/` doesn't exist), the final `echo` still runs ✅

### ⛓️ 2. Using `&&` – Run Next Command Only If Previous Succeeds

🔧 **Syntax:**

```bash
command1 && command2 && command3
```

🧪 **What it does:**  
Executes the next command **only if the previous one succeeded** (exit status is 0).

✅ **Example:**

```bash
mkdir project && cd project && touch readme.md
```

If `mkdir` works, it will `cd` into it and then create the file.  
If **any command fails**, the chain **stops** there.

❌ **Failure Case:**

```bash
mkdir project && cd notfound && echo "Ready"
```

🖥️ Output:

```bash
bash: cd: notfound: No such file or directory
```

👉 Since `cd` failed, `echo` never gets executed.

### 🚫 3. Using `||` – Run Next Command Only If Previous Fails

🔧 **Syntax:**

```bash
command1 || command2
```

🧪 **What it does:**  
Executes the next command **only if the previous one failed**.

✅ **Example:**

```bash
rm important.txt || echo "Could not delete file"
```

If `rm` fails, you get a clean fallback message.

🖥️ **Output:**

```bash
rm: cannot remove 'important.txt': No such file or directory
Could not delete file
```

---

### 🔄 4. Combining `&&` and `||` Together – Build Powerful One-Liners

✅ **Example:**

```bash
mkdir dir1 && echo "Created" || echo "Failed"
```

🧪 **What happens:**

* If `mkdir` succeeds → prints "Created"
    
* If `mkdir` fails → prints "Failed"
    

⚠️ But be careful — if `echo "Created"` fails for any reason, the `echo "Failed"` part will also run. To avoid confusion, use **grouping** like:

```bash
mkdir dir1 && { echo "Created"; } || echo "Failed"
```

---

### 🔥 5. Real World Combo Example

Let’s say you’re backing up a folder:

```bash
tar -czf backup.tar.gz /mydata && mv backup.tar.gz /backup || echo "Backup failed!"
```

* If `tar` works and the move succeeds → backup is moved ✅
    
* If either `tar` or `mv` fails → fallback message is printed ❌
    

### 😵‍💫 What If You Mix Wrong Commands?

#### Using `;` with a wrong command:

```bash
ls ; wrongcmd ; echo "End"
```

🖥️ Output:

```bash
<file listing>
bash: wrongcmd: command not found
End
```

👉 Even though `wrongcmd` failed, `echo "End"` still runs — `;` doesn’t care about errors.

#### Using `&&` with a wrong command:

```bash
ls && wrongcmd && echo "Final step"
```

🖥️ Output:

```bash
<file listing>
bash: wrongcmd: command not found
```

👉 After `wrongcmd` fails, everything stops. `echo` is skipped.

### 🧠 Summary of Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `;` | Sequential execution | Runs all commands, regardless of success/failure |
| `&&` | Logical AND | Runs next command **only if** the previous succeeds |
| \` |  | \` |

### 🧪 Pro Tips for Real Scripts

✅ Use `&&` to **chain success-based actions**  
✅ Use `||` for **fallback/error handling**  
✅ Combine them smartly for **clean, readable logic**  
✅ Wrap complex logic in `{}` and split across lines with `\` if needed

```bash
mkdir logs && { cd logs && touch log.txt; } || echo "Something went wrong"
```

# ✍️ Mastering the `vi` Editor in Linux

Welcome to the **vi editor** — your terminal-based text editor that exists in **every Linux system by default**. It's fast, lightweight, powerful, and once you know the basics, there's **no going back**!

### 🚪 Opening a File in `vi`

```bash
vi filename
```

* If the file exists → it opens it for editing.
    
* If it doesn’t → it creates a new file with that name.
    

🧪 Example:

```bash
vi notes.txt
```

### 🧠 vi Has 2 Main Modes

| Mode | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| **Command** | Navigate, delete, copy, save, quit, etc. |
| **Insert** | Actually type/edit the content |

You always **start in Command Mode**. To begin typing, you must enter **Insert Mode**.

### ✍️ Getting into Insert Mode

Just press one of these in Command Mode:

| Key | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| `i` | Insert before cursor |
| `I` | Insert at beginning of line |
| `a` | Append after cursor |
| `A` | Append at end of line |
| `o` | Open new line below & insert |
| `O` | Open new line above & insert |

### ⌨️ Moving Around in Command Mode

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `h` | Left |
| `l` | Right |
| `j` | Down |
| `k` | Up |
| `0` | Move to line start |
| `$` | Move to line end |
| `G` | Go to last line |
| `gg` | Go to first line |

🧠 Pro Tip: Use numbers! `10j` moves down 10 lines quickly.

### 🔥 Basic Actions in Command Mode

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dd` | Delete entire line |
| `x` | Delete one character under cursor |
| `u` | Undo last change |
| `yy` | Copy current line (yank) |
| `p` | Paste after current line |
| `/text` | Search for “text” in the file |
| `n` | Repeat the last search |

### 💾 Saving and Quitting

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `:w` | Save (write) |
| `:q` | Quit |
| `:wq` | Save and quit (most used) |
| `:q!` | Quit without saving |
| `ZZ` | Save and quit (shortcut) |

### 🧪 Real Example – Create a Simple Note

```bash
vi match.txt
```

Then press `i` and type:

```bash
RCB vs MI - April 15
Winner: MI
Player of the Match: Jasprit Bumrah
```

Now press `Esc`, then type:

```bash
:wq
```

🎉 Boom! You’ve just created a file using `vi`.

### 😎 Real Use Cases

* Writing configuration files (e.g., `/etc/fstab`, `/etc/hosts`)
    
* Editing shell scripts or cron jobs
    
* Quickly viewing logs or making real-time changes on remote servers (via SSH)
    
* Emergency edits when GUI editors aren’t available
    

### **Vim vs Vi: Usage Difference**

While **Vi** and **Vim** are both text editors, they serve similar purposes but with key differences that affect how you use them, especially in a system administration or development environment.

#### **1\. Features & Functionality:**

* **Vi**:
    
    * **Basic Editing**: Vi is a no-frills editor that's available by default on almost every Unix-based system. It offers basic functionality for editing and saving files, but lacks advanced features that would enhance productivity.
        
    * **No Syntax Highlighting**: Doesn’t provide syntax highlighting, which can make reading and editing code harder, especially for developers.
        
    * **Basic Navigation**: Vi uses simple navigation commands like `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` for moving around in text and requires switching between **Command** and **Insert** modes to perform actions.
        
* **Vim**:
    
    * **Enhanced Editing**: Vim builds upon Vi’s capabilities and adds **syntax highlighting**, which makes it easier to work with programming languages, configuration files, and markup languages.
        
    * **Multi-level Undo/Redo**: Unlike Vi, Vim allows you to undo and redo multiple changes, making it much more versatile for working on larger files.
        
    * **Advanced Navigation**: Vim offers a better navigation system with features like **Visual mode** for selecting text, **search with regular expressions**, and even the ability to split the window into multiple panes for multitasking.
        

#### **2\. Usability for Developers & Admins:**

* **Vi**:
    
    * **Quick Fixes**: Great for basic text editing, such as changing configurations, making quick fixes, or editing system files when you're working on a minimal setup.
        
    * **No Advanced Customization**: Limited options for configuring the editor to suit personal preferences or to support advanced workflows.
        
* **Vim**:
    
    * **Developer-Friendly**: Vim is ideal for developers due to its advanced features like **auto-completion**, **line numbering**, **integrated help**, and **plugin support**. These features make Vim an excellent choice for writing code, scripts, or working on large configuration files.
        
    * **Customizable**: Vim can be fully customized using the `.vimrc` configuration file. You can set up key bindings, customize themes, and even add plugins for extra functionality (e.g., Git integration, linters, auto-formatters).
        

#### **3\. Performance:**

* **Vi**:
    
    * **Lightweight**: As a minimal editor, Vi runs efficiently even on very low-resource systems. It’s perfect when you're working in environments where minimal resources are available, such as in rescue modes or remote servers.
        
* **Vim**:
    
    * **Feature-Rich but Slightly Heavier**: Vim can be more resource-intensive due to its added features, but it's still lightweight compared to most graphical text editors. It strikes a balance between usability and performance, especially for long-term use.
        

#### **4\. Extensibility:**

* **Vi**:
    
    * **Limited**: Vi doesn’t support plugins or extensions. What you see is what you get – no extra functionality beyond what’s built in.
        
* **Vim**:
    
    * **Highly Extensible**: Vim supports numerous plugins and extensions that can boost productivity. You can add linters, debuggers, and integrate with tools like **git** or **Docker** directly within the editor.
        

### **Which One Should You Use?**

* **Vi**: If you’re in a situation where you need to edit a file on a system with limited resources, or you're working on a system that doesn’t have Vim installed (e.g., minimal Linux installations), Vi will get the job done. It’s also great for quick, simple edits when you need to fix something fast.
    
* **Vim**: If you’re working on larger projects, writing code, or need a more feature-rich and customizable editing experience, Vim is the go-to choice. It’s ideal for system administrators, DevOps professionals, and developers who need an efficient, powerful editor that can handle everything from configuration files to programming.
    

Alright, let's dive into `sed` – a powerful stream editor used in Unix/Linux for processing and transforming text. Here's a breakdown of what `sed` is, how to use it, and a real-world use case.

### **What is** `sed`?

`sed` (short for **stream editor**) is a command-line tool used for **text processing**. It reads input line by line, applies specified transformations (such as substitution, deletion, or insertion), and outputs the result.

### **Basic Syntax:**

```bash
sed [OPTION]... 'COMMAND' file...
```

* `OPTION`: Flags that modify the behavior of `sed`.
    
* `COMMAND`: The operation you want `sed` to perform (e.g., `s`, `d`, `i`, etc.).
    
* `file`: The file or input stream that `sed` processes.
    

### **Commonly Used** `sed` Commands:

* **Substitution (**`s`): Replace a pattern in the text.
    
* **Deletion (**`d`): Remove lines that match a pattern.
    
* **Insertion (**`i`): Add text before a line.
    
* **Append (**`a`): Add text after a line.
    
* **Print (**`p`): Print the lines that match a pattern.
    

### **1\. Substitution (**`s`)

The most common operation in `sed` is substitution. It follows this format:

```bash
sed 's/old_pattern/new_pattern/' file
```

* `s/old_pattern/new_pattern/`: Substitute `old_pattern` with `new_pattern` on each line.
    
* **Options**:
    
    * `g`: Apply substitution globally (on all occurrences in a line).
        
    * `p`: Print lines where substitution occurred.
        
    * `i`: Ignore case while matching.
        

#### **Example 1: Simple Substitution**

Replace "apple" with "orange" in a file:

```bash
sed 's/apple/orange/' fruits.txt
```

**Input (**`fruits.txt`):

```bash
apple
banana
apple pie
```

**Output:**

```bash
orange
banana
apple pie
```

(Only the first occurrence of "apple" is replaced on each line by default.)

#### **Example 2: Global Substitution**

Replace all occurrences of "apple" with "orange" globally:

```bash
sed 's/apple/orange/g' fruits.txt
```

**Output:**

```bash
orange
banana
orange pie
```

#### **Example 3: Case-insensitive Substitution**

Replace "apple" with "orange" (case-insensitive):

```bash
sed 's/apple/orange/i' fruits.txt
```

**Input:**

```bash
Apple
apple
APPLE pie
```

**Output:**

```bash
orange
orange
APPLE pie
```

### **2\. Deletion (**`d`)

You can delete lines that match a specific pattern using the `d` command.

#### **Example 1: Delete Lines Containing a Pattern**

Delete all lines that contain the word "banana":

```bash
sed '/banana/d' fruits.txt
```

**Input (**`fruits.txt`):

```bash
apple
banana
cherry
banana split
```

**Output:**

```bash
apple
cherry
```

### **3\. Insertion (**`i`)

You can insert a line before a specified pattern using the `i` command.

#### **Example: Insert Text Before a Line**

Insert "This is a fruit" before every line that contains the word "apple":

```bash
sed '/apple/i This is a fruit' fruits.txt
```

**Input (**`fruits.txt`):

```bash
apple
banana
apple pie
```

**Output:**

```bash
This is a fruit
apple
banana
This is a fruit
apple pie
```

### **4\. Append (**`a`)

You can append text after a specified line using the `a` command.

#### **Example: Append Text After a Line**

Append "Fruit end" after every line that contains the word "banana":

```bash
sed '/banana/a Fruit end' fruits.txt
```

**Input (**`fruits.txt`):

```bash
apple
banana
cherry
banana split
```

**Output:**

```bash
apple
banana
Fruit end
cherry
banana split
Fruit end
```

### **5\. Print (**`p`)

Print specific lines that match a pattern. Often used with `-n` option to suppress automatic printing of lines.

#### **Example: Print Only Lines Containing a Pattern**

Print only the lines that contain the word "apple":

```bash
sed -n '/apple/p' fruits.txt
```

**Input (**`fruits.txt`):

```bash
apple
banana
cherry
apple pie
```

**Output:**

```bash
apple
apple pie
```

### **Real-World Use Case:**

Imagine you have a **log file** (`access.log`) and you want to extract specific information from it. Let’s say you need to:

1. **Remove unnecessary lines** (such as comment lines starting with `#`).
    
2. **Replace IP addresses** with a placeholder for privacy.
    
3. **Print lines containing specific error codes** (e.g., 404 errors).
    

Here’s how you could do this with `sed`:

#### **Example: Process a Log File**

```bash
# Remove lines with comments (starting with #)
sed '/^#/d' access.log > clean_log.txt

# Replace IP addresses with 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'
sed 's/\([0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\)/xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/g' clean_log.txt > anonymized_log.txt

# Print lines with error code 404
sed -n '/ 404 /p' anonymized_log.txt > error_404_log.txt
```

#### **Input (**`access.log`):

```bash
swiftCopyEdit# This is a comment
192.168.1.1 - - [10/Apr/2025:06:10:00 +0000] "GET /index.html" 200 1024
192.168.1.2 - - [10/Apr/2025:06:11:00 +0000] "GET /about.html" 404 512
```

#### **Output:**

1. **clean\_log.txt**:
    
    ```bash
    192.168.1.1 - - [10/Apr/2025:06:10:00 +0000] "GET /index.html" 200 1024
    192.168.1.2 - - [10/Apr/2025:06:11:00 +0000] "GET /about.html" 404 512
    ```
    
2. **anonymized\_log.txt**:
    
    ```bash
    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [10/Apr/2025:06:10:00 +0000] "GET /index.html" 200 1024
    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [10/Apr/2025:06:11:00 +0000] "GET /about.html" 404 512
    ```
    
3. **error\_404\_log.txt**:
    
    ```bash
    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [10/Apr/2025:06:11:00 +0000] "GET /about.html" 404 512
    ```
    

This is a simple example of using `sed` to process logs, anonymize data, and extract useful information in one go!

### 🔚 **Conclusion: Wrapping Up Chapter 10**

Chapter 10 was all about sharpening your Linux skills with **real-world file management and processing tools** — tools every system admin, DevOps engineer, or power user must know.

We explored how to:

* **Compress and uncompress files**, and how modern tools like `tar`, `gzip`, and `gunzip` take it up a notch in real-world scenarios.
    
* Use `truncate` to shrink or extend files effortlessly.
    
* **Split and combine files** to manage huge data sets or logs smartly.
    
* Run **multiple commands in one shot** using `;`, speeding up your workflow.
    
* Revisit the **vi editor** for more hands-on editing, then go a step further with the **powerful Vim**, built for modern DevOps and development workflows.
    
* And finally, we dipped our toes into `sed`, a stream editor that’s practically a Swiss Army knife for text transformation on the command line.
    

Each of these commands is a **power move** when you're managing servers, automating workflows, or troubleshooting under pressure. Learn them, practice them, **master them** — because the faster and smarter you work in Linux, the more you unlock your true DevOps potential. 💪
