## 👥 **Understanding Types of Users in Linux**

Before we jump into user creation and management, it's *super important* to understand the **types of users** in a Linux system. Linux is built as a multi-user operating system — and this is where it all begins.

### 1️⃣ Normal User

These are regular human users — like you and me. When you create a new user using the `useradd` or `adduser` command, you’re usually creating a **normal user**.

🛠️ **Use Case**:

* Developers, admins, or employees accessing their accounts.
    
* Each normal user gets a home directory like `/home/username`.
    

```bash
useradd durga
passwd durga
```

🔐 Has limited access. Cannot install software, modify system files, or manage other users unless explicitly granted permissions.

### 2️⃣ Superuser (root)

This is **God mode** on Linux. The **root user** has unrestricted access to *everything* in the system.

🛠️ **Use Case**:

* System-level maintenance
    
* Software installation, firewall rules, managing all users/files
    

```bash
# Switch to root (if you're allowed)
su -
```

⚠️ **Caution**: Root can **destroy the entire system** with a single wrong command (`rm -rf /`). Never run as root unless needed.

### 3️⃣ Sudo User

Not everyone should use root. That’s where **sudo** comes in — a way to *temporarily* gain root privileges.

🛠️ **Use Case**:

* Run just one command with elevated access
    
* Great for admins who shouldn't be full-time root
    

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo useradd tester
```

🔐 Behind the scenes, `/etc/sudoers` or `/etc/sudoers.d/` controls who can use `sudo`.

✅ **Troubleshooting Tip**: If a user can’t run `sudo`, add them to the `sudo` or `wheel` group:

```bash
usermod -aG sudo username  # On Debian/Ubuntu
usermod -aG wheel username # On RHEL/CentOS
```

### 4️⃣ System User

System users are created by the OS or installed services — not humans.

📁 They usually **don’t have a home directory** or login shell (`/usr/sbin/nologin` or `/bin/false`).

🛠️ **Examples**:

* `daemon`, `nobody`, `sshd`, `mysql`, `www-data`
    

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep -E "^(daemon|mysql|sshd)"
```

🧠 You won’t interact with these users often, but they’re essential for services to run securely.

### 5️⃣ Service Users

A subset of system users — these are tied to specific services (like `nginx`, `mysql`, etc.). Linux isolates each service with its own user, improving **security**.

✅ Real Use Case: If a service like Apache gets compromised, the damage is limited because it runs as `www-data`, not root.

### 💡 Pro Tip:

You can identify system vs. normal users based on **UID ranges**:

* **0** → root
    
* **1–999** → system users
    
* **1000+** → normal users
    

```bash
awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 { print $1, $3 }' /etc/passwd
```

## 👥 Creating, Modifying & Deleting Users and Groups in Linux (With Real-Life Context, My Style 😎)

### 🧑‍💻 You should understand why this is ...

Creating a user is **not just about running** `useradd` and moving on — you’re literally giving someone a key 🔑 to your server. It’s like onboarding someone into your Linux house. So you better set the rules right from the beginning — which room (home directory) they can access, what they can touch (permissions), and which club (group) they belong to. Let’s go step by step 🔍

### ✨ 1. Creating Users the Right Way

#### ✅ Command: `useradd`

🧾 **Syntax:**

```bash
sudo useradd [options] username
```

#### 💬 Example 1: Create a basic user with home directory

```bash
sudo useradd -m revanth
sudo passwd revanth
```

💡 *What’s happening here?*

* `-m` creates a home directory `/home/revanth`
    
* You’ll set the password using `passwd`
    
* Now this user can login and start working
    

#### 💬 Example 2: Give more details during creation

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -c "DevOps Intern" -G devops -e 2025-06-01 intern1
sudo passwd intern1
```

🔍 *What this does:*

* Home directory ✔️
    
* Bash shell ✔️
    
* Added comment (you can track purpose) ✔️
    
* Added to `devops` group ✔️
    
* Account expires after project deadline ✔️
    

🧠 **Use Case**: Interns, contract-based devs, temporary access 🔐

📢 **Linux Team Says**: Always think — *What does this user need access to?* Add them to the right group and restrict expiry if it's temporary.

## 🛠️ Full-Form `useradd` Command — Explained with All Options

```bash
sudo useradd -g groupname -G secondarygroup1,secondarygroup2 -s /bin/bash -c "User Description" -m -d /home/username -e 2025-12-31 -f 10 username
```

### 📘 What Each Option Means:

| Option | What it Does |
| --- | --- |
| `-g` | Sets the **primary group** |
| `-G` | Adds to **secondary group(s)** (comma-separated) |
| `-s` | Sets the **login shell** |
| `-c` | Adds a **comment** or description |
| `-m` | **Creates** the home directory |
| `-d` | **Defines** a custom home directory |
| `-e` | **Account expiry date** (format: YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `-f` | Sets **inactive days** after password expiry (before disabling account) |
| `username` | The actual **login name** you're creating |

---

### 🎯 Example: Creating a Full User Account

```bash
sudo useradd -g devops -G docker,sudo -s /bin/bash -c "DevOps Engineer" -m -d /home/teja -e 2025-12-31 -f 7 teja
sudo passwd teja
```

🧠 **What did we just do?**

* Created user `teja`
    
* Primary group: `devops`
    
* Secondary groups: `docker`, `sudo` (for elevated access)
    
* Shell: `/bin/bash`
    
* Home: `/home/teja`
    
* Description: “DevOps Engineer”
    
* Account expires on Dec 31, 2025
    
* 7 days grace period after password expiry
    
* And finally set password with `passwd`
    

### 🔐 Use Case: Why This Matters

Say you're in a company onboarding a DevOps engineer. You want:

* Them to access Docker
    
* Use sudo for limited admin tasks
    
* Automatically revoke their account when contract ends
    
* Keep logs readable with their name & description
    
* Clean separation in file structure (`/home/teja`)
    

This exact command does all of it in one shot 🚀

### 🚨 Bonus Tip: Don't Forget to Verify!

After creating a user like this, always verify:

```bash
id teja
```

Expected output:

```bash
uid=1002(teja) gid=1003(devops) groups=1003(devops),998(docker),27(sudo)
```

Also check their login shell and expiry:

```bash
chage -l teja
```

Example output:

```bash
Last password change				: Apr 15, 2025
Password expires					: never
Password inactive					: 7 days
Account expires						: Dec 31, 2025
```

### ✏️ 2. Modifying Existing Users

#### ✅ Command: `usermod`

🧾 **Syntax:**

```bash
sudo usermod [options] username
```

#### 💬 Example 1: Add user to an extra group

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker revanth
```

☝️ *Important:* The `-a` flag means **append** — without it, they’ll get removed from other groups!

#### 💬 Example 2: Change user’s default shell

```bash
sudo usermod -s /bin/zsh revanth
```

### ❌ 3. Deleting Users (When They’re Done)

#### ✅ Command: `userdel`

🧾 **Syntax:**

```bash
sudo userdel [options] username
```

#### 💬 Example 1: Simple delete

```bash
sudo userdel revanth
```

#### 💬 Example 2: Delete user with their home directory

```bash
sudo userdel -r intern1
```

📛 **Reminder**: This only deletes their `/home` directory, not files they created elsewhere (like `/var/www`, etc.) — you'll have to manually clean those up.

### 👪 Creating Groups (Because Users Need Belonging Too 😎)

#### ✅ Command: `groupadd`

```bash
sudo groupadd devops
```

🧠 Use it when building a **team** — like all DevOps engineers go into `devops`, backend devs into `backend`, and so on.

### ✏️ Modifying Groups

#### ✅ Command: `groupmod`

```bash
sudo groupmod -n devops_team devops
```

🗣️ *Says*: You can rename groups as teams grow or change — good for clarity.

### ❌ Deleting Groups

#### ✅ Command: `groupdel`

```bash
sudo groupdel devops_team
```

⛔ Warning: This **won’t affect** the users, but they’ll no longer be part of that group.

### 🔄 Real-Life Workflow (All Combined)

Let’s say you onboarded a DevOps intern named `abhi`:

```bash
sudo useradd -m -c "DevOps Intern" -s /bin/bash -G devops abhi
sudo passwd abhi
```

✅ Done. Account created. Shell set. Group joined. Expiry assigned.

### 🧯 Troubleshooting Table – Common User Management Issues

Managing users is powerful — but sometimes, things break 😅. Here’s a quick table to help you resolve common user management issues on Linux systems.

#### 🔧 Troubleshooting Table

| 🧩 **Problem** | ⚠️ **Cause** | 🛠️ **Fix** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `useradd: user already exists` | Username already exists | Use `id username` to verify, or choose a different username |
| Home directory not created | Forgot `-m` option during creation | Manually `mkdir /home/username` or recreate using `-m` |
| `usermod` not working as expected | Forgot `-a` while adding to groups | Always use `-aG`, e.g., `usermod -aG devops user` |
| `userdel: user is logged in` | User has active session | Run `pkill -KILL -u username` or reboot the system |
| `useradd: group 'groupname' does not exist` | Group not created | Create it first: `sudo groupadd groupname` |
| No home directory or login fails | Missing `-m` or misconfigured user shell | Use `-m` with `useradd` or manually create home directory |
| User can’t use `sudo` | Not in `sudo` group | Add to sudo: `usermod -aG sudo username` |
| Shell not working or stuck | Wrong shell assigned | Fix with `chsh -s /bin/bash username` |

✅ **Pro Tip:** Always double-check `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` to verify user and group info. Use `getent passwd` and `getent group` to confirm from the system database.

### 🌟 Pro Tip – Script Your User Creation

For onboarding multiple users, you can even create a small script using this command in a loop!

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for name in teja ravi krishna
do
  sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G docker,sudo $name
  echo "$name:Welcome@123" | sudo chpasswd
done
```

## 👥 Understanding Groups in Linux: Primary vs Secondary

### 🤔 Why Do We Need Groups?

When you work with multiple users on a system (especially in a DevOps or multi-admin environment), you need to manage who can **access what** — files, directories, and system features. That’s where **groups** come in!

Linux groups allow you to **assign permissions collectively** rather than individually. Efficient, secure, and scalable.

### 🧠 Types of Groups:

1. **Primary Group**:
    
    * Automatically assigned when a user is created.
        
    * Every file the user creates will belong to this group by default.
        
    * Only **one primary group** per user.
        
2. **Secondary (Supplementary) Groups**:
    
    * Additional groups a user belongs to.
        
    * A user can be part of **multiple secondary groups**.
        
    * Useful for giving access to shared directories, tools, or project folders.
        

### 🔍 Check a User’s Groups

```bash
groups username
```

**Example:**

```bash
$ groups revanth
revanth : revanth devops docker
```

Here:

* `revanth` is the **primary group**
    
* `devops` and `docker` are **secondary groups**
    

### 🛠️ Creating a Group

```bash
sudo groupadd devops
```

You can check if it was created using:

```bash
getent group devops
```

### 👤 Creating a User with Primary Group Assigned

```bash
sudo useradd -g devops -m -s /bin/bash revanth
```

* `-g devops`: sets **primary group**
    
* `-m`: creates home directory
    
* `-s /bin/bash`: sets default shell
    

### 👥 Adding a User to a Secondary Group

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker revanth
```

* `-aG`: append to group (`a` = append, `G` = group)
    
* Don’t forget `-a` — missing it **will override existing groups!** 😱
    

### ✅ Check Group Membership Again

```bash
$ groups revanth
revanth : devops docker
```

### 🔥 Real-Life Scenario

Let’s say you're on a DevOps team:

* You have a `devops` group with access to `/opt/devops-tools`
    
* You create a new intern account and add them to this group:
    

```bash
sudo useradd -g interns -m -s /bin/bash bablu
sudo usermod -aG devops bablu
```

Now Bablu can access tools used by the devops team without giving him root access.

### 🚨 Troubleshooting Group Issues

| 🧩 Issue | 🛠️ Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Changes not reflecting | User may need to **logout and login again** |
| Wrong group permissions on files | Use `chown :groupname file` or `chmod g+rw file` |
| Can't add user to group | Ensure group exists (`getent group groupname`) |

## 🧰 Modifying & Deleting Users and Groups in Linux

### ✏️ Modifying a User: `usermod`

You might need to change a user's **shell**, **home directory**, or **group memberships** after they've been created. That’s where `usermod` comes in.

### 🔁 Common `usermod` Options

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-l newname` | Change the username |
| `-d /new/home` | Change home directory |
| `-m` | Move contents to new home directory |
| `-s /bin/zsh` | Change default shell |
| `-g group` | Change **primary** group |
| `-aG groups` | Add to **secondary** groups (append!) |

### 🔧 Example 1: Change Username

```bash
sudo usermod -l newrevanth revanth
```

➡️ Changes username from `revanth` to `newrevanth`  
*(Home directory remains the same unless changed manually)*

### 🔧 Example 2: Change User’s Home Directory

```bash
sudo usermod -d /home/devopsuser -m revanth
```

➡️ Sets new home and moves old contents there

### 🔧 Example 3: Change Shell

```bash
sudo usermod -s /bin/zsh revanth
```

➡️ Changes the default shell to Zsh

### ⚠️ Remember:

* **Always use** `-a` with `-G` or it will remove existing group memberships!
    

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker,nginx revanth
```

## 🧨 Deleting a User: `userdel`

Sometimes you have to remove users — interns leaving, access revocations, or cleanup tasks.

### 🔥 Basic Syntax:

```bash
sudo userdel username
```

➡️ This removes the user **but not** their home directory

### 💣 Delete User with Home Directory

```bash
sudo userdel -r revanth
```

➡️ Deletes both user and their home directory (`/home/revanth`)  
⚠️ Be careful — this action is **irreversible**!

### 🕵️ Real-World Use Case:

After an intern named `bablu` leaves the company:

```bash
sudo userdel -r bablu
```

Done. No lingering access.

## 🧼 Modifying & Deleting Groups

Just like users, groups can be modified or deleted.

### 🔧 Rename Group

```bash
sudo groupmod -n newdevops devops
```

➡️ Renames `devops` group to `newdevops`

### 💣 Delete a Group

```bash
sudo groupdel devops
```

➡️ Only works if **no users** are currently assigned to the group.

### 🧯 Troubleshooting Tips

| 🧩 Problem | ⚒️ Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `userdel: user is currently logged in` | Run `pkill -KILL -u username` or wait until user logs out |
| `groupdel: group is in use` | Remove all users from group before deletion |
| Shell doesn’t change after update | Logout and re-login, or run `exec bash` / `exec zsh` |
| Username change breaks ownership | Use `find / -user oldname -exec chown newname {} \;` to fix ownership |

## 🧾 Understanding Essential Linux User & Group Files

### 1\. `/etc/passwd` – User Account Information

This file holds basic user info — **username**, **UID**, **GID**, home directory, and shell.

### 📄 File Format

Each line = one user

```bash
username:x:UID:GID:comment:/home/dir:/bin/bash
```

Example:

```bash
revanth:x:1001:1001:Revanth Goura:/home/revanth:/bin/bash
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `username` | Login name |
| `x` | Placeholder for password (in shadow) |
| `UID` | User ID |
| `GID` | Primary Group ID |
| `comment` | Full name or description |
| `home` | User’s home directory |
| `shell` | Login shell |

### 🔎 View User Info

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep revanth
```

Or use:

```bash
getent passwd revanth
```

### 2\. `/etc/shadow` – Secure Password Info 🔐

This file stores **encrypted user passwords**, **password expiry**, and **aging rules**.

### 🔐 Only root can read this:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/shadow | grep revanth
```

Example:

```bash
revanth:$6$3hjHD...:19345:0:99999:7:::
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `$6$` | Hash type (SHA-512) |
| `19345` | Last password change (days since 1970) |
| `0` | Min days between password changes |
| `99999` | Max password age |
| `7` | Warning before expiry |

### 3\. `/etc/group` – Group Info

This file lists all groups and which users belong to them.

### 📄 File Format

```bash
groupname:x:GID:member1,member2
```

Example:

```bash
docker:x:998:revanth,bablu
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `groupname` | Group name |
| `x` | Placeholder (password, rarely used) |
| `GID` | Group ID |
| `members` | Users in the group |

### 🔍 Check User’s Groups

```bash
groups revanth
```

Or:

```bash
grep revanth /etc/group
```

### 4\. `/etc/gshadow` – Secure Group Passwords (Rarely Used)

Contains encrypted group passwords and admin users for each group.  
Mostly unused in modern Linux systems but still exists.

### ⚠️ Permissions

* `/etc/passwd` — readable by all
    
* `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/gshadow` — only root
    
* `/etc/group` — readable by all
    

## 📘 Real-World Scenario: Why These Files Matter

🔒 You’re auditing a server and find login issues for a user:

1. Check `/etc/passwd` — Is the shell `/bin/bash` or `/sbin/nologin`?
    
2. Check `/etc/shadow` — Is the password expired or locked?
    
3. Check `/etc/group` — Does the user belong to the correct group?
    
4. Use `chage -l username` to inspect password aging.
    

🔐 Admin-level debugging = knowing where to look 👨‍💻

## 🛠️ Common Fixes Using These Files

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Login shell broken | Update using `chsh -s /bin/bash username` |
| Password expired | `sudo chage -M 99999 username` |
| User not in group | `sudo usermod -aG groupname username` |
| UID/GID conflicts | Check `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/group` and assign unique values |

✅ We’ve wrapped up **Part 1** just as planned — strong start with user types, creation, groups, and system files 💪. Tomorrow, we’ll dive deep into **Part 2** with:

* Password aging policies
    
* `/etc/login.defs` config
    
* Switching users (su/sudo)
    
* Locking/unlocking accounts
    
* LDAP, PAM basics
    
* Real-world best practices
    

## 🎯 Conclusion – User Management Isn’t Just a Command, It’s a Responsibility!

Hey, now you know... creating users is not just about typing `useradd` and walking away. It's about **giving someone a ticket to enter your Linux system** — so it better be the right person, with the right permissions, in the right group!

In this chapter, we explored:

✅ The different **types of users** – from root to service accounts  
✅ How to **create, modify, and delete users and groups**  
✅ The **important system files** (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, etc.) that make everything work  
✅ How to manage **primary vs. secondary groups** and **troubleshoot common issues**  
✅ Best practices with real-world use cases that make you ready for interviews and production environments

This is the kind of stuff that separates a **regular user** from a **real Linux admin** 🧠💪.

🧠 **Up Next in Part 2**  
We’ll go beyond basic account creation and into **real-world security and authentication topics**:

🔐 Password aging, `/etc/login.defs`  
🔁 Switching users (su, sudo), locking/unlocking accounts  
🌐 Authentication mechanisms – LDAP, PAM  
✅ Real-time examples and best practices
