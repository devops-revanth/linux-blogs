### 🎯 **Objective:**

This project’s main focus is to help anyone practice Linux, from **Zero to Hero**. Once you've completed the tasks, you'll feel confident to take the **RHCSA exam**. If I missed anything or if you have suggestions to improve this blog, please share them! If you get stuck anywhere, feel free to comment below — I’m here to help, and we can learn together. Let’s dive into Linux and grow our skills step by step!  

* Understanding the **Filesystem structure** & **navigation**.
    
* Performing **File operations** (create, move, edit, and delete).
    
* Practicing **File display commands** and **text editing**.
    
* Exploring **Linking concepts** (hard and soft links).
    
* Managing **Permissions, ownership**, and **ACLs**.
    
* Applying **Text processing commands** (like `cut`, `sort`, `grep`, `wc`, etc.).
    

You'll practice these tasks using IPL team names for files and directories, making learning engaging and fun.

### ✅ **Pre-Requisite**:

1. **Two Servers Setup**: Either on Cloud (AWS/Azure) or using VirtualBox locally.
    
2. **User Access**: Perform all tasks using a normal user (not root).
    
3. **System Ready**: Make sure your systems are installed and accessible with login — same as in **Chapter 3**.

> 💡 **Note**: This project is structured in a task-based manner. You will only be given tasks here. If you have any doubts or get stuck, feel free to **comment below**, and we’ll solve them together. This is meant to be hands-on and enjoyable — like a match day! 🏏🔥

Explore the **filesystem structure** using basic **navigation** and **path**\-related commands such as **cd** (change directory), **pwd** (print working directory), and **ls** (list directory contents). These commands help you move through directories, view your current location, and list the files and folders within directories.

### 📁 **1\. IPL Setup: File & Directory Creation**

* **Create 10 files under your home directory, each named after an IPL team:**
    
    ```bash
    csk, rcb, mi, dc, rr, kkr, pbks, gt, lsg, srh
    ```
    
* **Create 3 directories based on zone:**
    
    ```bash
    south-zone, north-zone, central-zone
    ```
    
* **Move teams into zones like:**
    
    * **south-zone: csk, rcb, srh, lsg**
        
    * **north-zone: pbks, mi, dc**
        
    * **central-zone: rr, kkr, gt**
        

### 📝 **2\. Add Content to Files**

* For each file inside the zones, use **vi or redirection** to add **11 player names** for each team or file.
    
    **Below are some** **vi operations — feel free to play around and get comfortable with editing!"**
    

### 🔗 **3\. Links in Linux – Hard & Soft Links**

* ✅ Choose one team file and add content for example **rcb**, and add some content
    
* ✅ Create a **soft link** (**symbolic link**) to **rcb** inside /tmp
    
* ✅ Create a **hard link** to **rcb** inside **/tmp or within the same filesystem**:
    
* ✅ Compare **inode numbers** of the original file and both links either using **stat** or **ls -li**
    
* ✅ View the content of the soft and hard links using **cat** or **vi** to verify the content is the same
    
* ✅ Use the stat command on each file to examine:
    
    * Inode number
        
    * File permissions
        
    * Number of hard links
        
    * Access/modification/change timestamps
        
* ✅ Now , Edit the original file and verify if changes reflect in the links
    
* ✅ Try deleting the original file **rcb** and observe the behavior of both links using **cat** and **stat**.
    
* ✅ (Optional) Take a backup using **cp** before deleting
    
* ✅ Check the behavior of soft and hard links after deletion
    
    * Soft link will **break** (shows broken link)
        
    * Hard link will **still work**
        

### 🔁 (Optional) Additional Tasks to Deepen Understanding

* ✅ Rename the original file and observe the effect
    
    * Check if the soft link still works
        
    * Check if the hard link still works
        
* ✅ Delete the soft link and verify it doesn’t affect the original or hard link
    
* ✅ Use **ls -l** to compare file types
    
    * Soft link will show **l** and point to the original file
        
    * Hard link will appear just like a regular file
        
* ✅ Create a soft link to a directory
    
    * Use **cd** to navigate through the soft link
        
    * Verify structure and behavior
        
* ✅ Try to create a hard link to a directory
    
    * Observe the system error (usually not allowed)
        
* ✅ Use **find** with **\-samefile** or **\-inum** to discover all hard links
    
    * find . -samefile &lt;filename&gt;
        
    * find . -inum &lt;inode\_number&gt;
        

## **🔎** 4. **find** Command Tasks

✅ Use the `find` command to search for all files named after IPL teams in your home directory  
• Example: Search for files like `rcb`, `mi`, etc.  
• If no results are found, check that the files exist and that you're in the correct directory.

✅ Find all files that were last modified in the last 7 days inside the `north-zone` directory  
• Example: Look for any files that have been recently edited in the `north-zone` directory.  
• If no results are returned, ensure that files in the `north-zone` directory have been modified recently.

✅ Use `find` to locate all files that contain the word "player" in their name under `/tmp`  
• Example: Look for files like `rcb-player`, `mi-player`, etc.  
• If no results appear, ensure there are files with "player" in their name under `/tmp`.

✅ Find all files that are larger than 1MB in size within the `south-zone`  
• Example: Locate any large files in the `south-zone` directory.  
• If no results show up, verify the file sizes in the directory to ensure some are greater than 1MB.

✅ Find and display all files that are symbolic links in the `/tmp` directory  
• Example: Locate all soft links to IPL team files created earlier.  
• If no results, ensure that soft links were created in `/tmp`.

## **🔎** 5. **locate** Command Tasks

✅ Use the `locate` command to quickly find a file by its name, e.g., `rcb`  
• Example: Locate the `rcb` file anywhere on the system.  
• If no results appear, check if the `locate` database is up to date (use `sudo updatedb`).

✅ Locate all files with names starting with “rr” (for the IPL team Rajasthan Royals)  
• Example: Find files like `rr`, `rr-players`, etc.  
• If no results are found, ensure that such files exist and verify that the `locate` database has been updated.

✅ Use `locate` to find files within the `south-zone` directory that were created after a specific date  
• Example: Look for recent files added in the `south-zone`.  
• If no results, verify that files have been created recently and check if the `locate` database is updated.

✅ Use `locate` with the `-i` flag to find all files related to IPL that ignore case sensitivity  
• Example: Search for files like `CSK`, `csk`, or `Csk`.  
• If no results appear, ensure that such files exist and the `locate` database is current.
