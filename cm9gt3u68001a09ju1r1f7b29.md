> [💡 **Note**: This project is structured in a task-based manner. Yo](https://blog.durgarevu.com/compress-split-and-automate-real-world-file-operations-in-linux)u will only be given tasks here. If you have any doubts or get stuck, feel free to **comment below**, and we’ll solve them together. This is meant to be hands-on and enjoyable — like a match day! 🏏🔥

Explore the **filesystem structure** using basic **navigation** and **path**\-related commands such as **cd** (change directory), **pwd** (print working directory), and **ls** (list directory contents). These commands help you move through directories, view your current location, and list the files and folders within directories.

### 📁 **1\. IPL Setup: File & Directory Creation**

* **Create 10 files under your home directory, each named after an IPL team:**
    
    ```bash
    csk, rcb, mi, dc, rr, kkr, pbks, gt, lsg, srh
    ```
    
* **Create 3 directories based on zone:**
    
    ```bash
    south-zone, north-zone, central-zone
    ```
    
* **Move teams into zones like:**
    
    * **south-zone: csk, rcb, srh, lsg**
        
    * **north-zone: pbks, mi, dc**
        
    * **central-zone: rr, kkr, gt**
        

### 📝 **2\. Add Content to Files**

* For each file inside the zones, use **vi or redirection** to add **11 player names** for each team or file.
    
    **Below are some** **vi operations — feel free to play around and get comfortable with editing!"**
    

### 🔗 **3\. Links in Linux – Hard & Soft Links**

* ✅ Choose one team file and add content for example **rcb**, and add some content
    
* ✅ Create a **soft link** (**symbolic link**) to **rcb** inside /tmp
    
* ✅ Create a **hard link** to **rcb** inside **/tmp or within the same filesystem**:
    
* ✅ Compare **inode numbers** of the original file and both links either using **stat** or **ls -li**
    
* ✅ View the content of the soft and hard links using **cat** or **vi** to verify the content is the same
    
* ✅ Use the stat command on each file to examine:
    
    * Inode number
        
    * File permissions
        
    * Number of hard links
        
    * Access/modification/change timestamps
        
* ✅ Now , Edit the original file and verify if changes reflect in the links
    
* ✅ Try deleting the original file **rcb** and observe the behavior of both links using **cat** and **stat**.
    
* ✅ (Optional) Take a backup using **cp** before deleting
    
* ✅ Check the behavior of soft and hard links after deletion
    
    * Soft link will **break** (shows broken link)
        
    * Hard link will **still work**
        

### 🔁 (Optional) Additional Tasks to Deepen Understanding

* ✅ Rename the original file and observe the effect
    
    * Check if the soft link still works
        
    * Check if the hard link still works
        
* ✅ Delete the soft link and verify it doesn’t affect the original or hard link
    
* ✅ Use **ls -l** to compare file types
    
    * Soft link will show **l** and point to the original file
        
    * Hard link will appear just like a regular file
        
* ✅ Create a soft link to a directory
    
    * Use **cd** to navigate through the soft link
        
    * Verify structure and behavior
        
* ✅ Try to create a hard link to a directory
    
    * Observe the system error (usually not allowed)
        
* ✅ Use **find** with **\-samefile** or **\-inum** to discover all hard links
    
    * find . -samefile &lt;filename&gt;
        
    * find . -inum &lt;inode\_number&gt;
        

## **🔎** 4. **find** Command Tasks

* ✅ Use the `find` command to search for all files named after IPL teams in your home directory
    
    * Example: Search for files like `rcb`, `mi`, etc.
        
    * If no results are found, check that the files exist and that you're in the correct directory.
        
* ✅ Find all files that were last modified in the last 7 days inside the `north-zone` directory
    
    * Example: Look for any files that have been recently edited in the `north-zone` directory.
        
    * If no results are returned, ensure that files in the `north-zone` directory have been modified recently.
        
* ✅ Use `find` to locate all files that contain the word "player" in their name under `/tmp`
    
    * Example: Look for files like `rcb-player`, `mi-player`, etc.
        
    * If no results appear, ensure there are files with "player" in their name under `/tmp`.
        
* ✅ Find all files that are larger than 1MB in size within the `south-zone`
    
    * Example: Locate any large files in the `south-zone` directory.
        
    * If no results show up, verify the file sizes in the directory to ensure some are greater than 1MB.
        
* ✅ Find and display all files that are symbolic links in the `/tmp` directory
    
    * Example: Locate all soft links to IPL team files created earlier.
        
    * If no results, ensure that soft links were created in `/tmp`.
        

## **🔎** 5. **locate** Command Tasks

* ✅ Use the `locate` command to quickly find a file by its name, e.g., `rcb`
    
    * Example: Locate the `rcb` file anywhere on the system.
        
    * If no results appear, check if the `locate` database is up to date (use `sudo updatedb`).
        
* ✅ Locate all files with names starting with “rr” (for the IPL team Rajasthan Royals)
    
    * Example: Find files like `rr`, `rr-players`, etc.
        
    * If no results are found, ensure that such files exist and verify that the `locate` database has been updated.
        
* ✅ Use `locate` to find files within the `south-zone` directory that were created after a specific date
    
    * Example: Look for recent files added in the `south-zone`.
        
    * If no results, verify that files have been created recently and check if the `locate` database is updated.
        
* ✅ Use `locate` with the `-i` flag to find all files related to IPL that ignore case sensitivity
    
    * Example: Search for files like `CSK`, `csk`, or `Csk`.
        
    * If no results appear, ensure that such files exist and the `locate` database is current.
        

## 🔐 **6\. Permissions & Ownership Tasks**

### 👤 **User & Group Setup**

* Create three users: `dhoni`, `virat`, and `rohit`.
    
* Create a group called `iplfans`.
    
* Add all three users to the `iplfans` group.
    
* Set passwords for each user.
    
* Verify group memberships using `groups` and `/etc/group`.
    

### 🔐 **Basic Permission Tasks**

* Ensure each IPL team file belongs to user `dhoni` and group `iplfans`.
    
* Use `chmod` to:
    
    * Give read-only permission to `rcb` file for others.
        
    * Grant read and write access to `csk` file only for owner.
        
    * Make `mi` file executable by the group.
        
    * Remove all permissions from `dc` file for others.
        

### 🔄 **Ownership Change Tasks**

* Change the owner of `rr` file to `virat`.
    
* Change the group of `pbks` file to `iplfans`.
    
* Change both owner and group of `gt` file to `rohit:iplfans`.
    
* Use `chown` and verify changes with `ls -l`.
    

### 🔍 **Verify & Troubleshoot**

* Use `ls -l` to verify permission, owner, group of all team files.
    
* Switch to each user (`su - username`) and try accessing each file:
    
    * Check which files `virat` can read/write.
        
    * Check if `rohit` can execute the `mi` file.
        
    * Check which files are inaccessible to `dhoni`.
        

### 📑 **Symbolic Permissions with Letters**

* Use `chmod u+x` to make `kkr` executable by its owner.
    
* Use `chmod g-w` to remove write permission for group on `srh`.
    
* Use `chmod o+r` to add read permission to `lsg` for others.
    

### 🔢 **Numeric Permissions Practice**

* Set permission `644` to `rcb`.
    
* Set permission `755` to `csk`.
    
* Set permission `600` to `mi`.
    
* Set permission `777` to `dc`.
    
* Practice with `stat` to compare symbolic vs numeric permissions.
    

### 📂 **Directory Permission Tasks**

* Create a directory called `ipl-archive`.
    
* Move all `.txt` team files into this directory.
    
* Use `chmod 700` on the directory.
    
* Try accessing it with another user — observe the result.
    
* Use `chmod 755` and try again.
    

### 🔁 **Recursive Permissions**

* **Apply Permissions Recursively**:
    
    * Use `chmod -R` to set permissions for a directory and all its contents.
        
        * Example: Set `755` permissions recursively on the `south-zone` directory.
            
    * Use `chown -R` to change ownership recursively.
        
        * Example: Change owner to `dhoni` and group to `iplfans` for the `north-zone` directory and its contents.
            
    * Use `chgrp -R` to change group ownership recursively.
        
        * Example: Change group to `iplfans` for the `central-zone` directory and its contents.
            

### 🛡️ **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**

* **Enable ACLs**:
    
    * Ensure the filesystem is mounted with ACL support.
        
* **Set ACLs**:
    
    * Use `setfacl` to grant read access to user `virat` on the `csk` file.
        
    * Use `setfacl` to grant write access to user `rohit` on the `mi` file.
        
* **View ACLs**:
    
    * Use `getfacl` to view the ACLs set on `csk` and `mi`.
        
* **Remove ACLs**:
    
    * Use `setfacl -x` to remove specific ACL entries.
        
    * Use `setfacl -b` to remove all ACL entries from a file.
        

### 📂 **Directory Permissions and Defaults**

* **Create a Directory**:
    
    * Create a directory named `iplarchive`.
        
* **Set Default ACLs**:
    
    * Use `setfacl -d` to set default ACLs for new files created in `iplarchive`.
        
        * Example: Grant read and write permissions to group `iplfans` by default.
            
* **Test Default ACLs**:
    
    * As user `dhoni`, create a new file in `iplarchive`.
        
    * Verify that the new file has the default ACLs applied.
        

### 🧪 **Verification and Testing**

* **List Permissions**:
    
    * Use `ls -l` to list permissions and identify special permission bits.
        
* **Check Effective Permissions**:
    
    * Use `namei -l` to trace permissions along a path.
        
* **Check ACLs**:
    
    * Use `getfacl` to verify ACL entries on files and directories.
        
* **Test Access**:
    
    * Switch between users (`su - username`) to test access rights as per the set permissions and ACLs.
