## Why? – The Challenge of Manual Server Patching

Imagine managing IT infrastructure for a banking customer with **800 servers** (Linux, Windows, and a few network devices). Every month, patching was mandatory to keep systems secure and compliant. On paper, this sounds simple. In reality, it was a nightmare:

* **Servers to patch:** 800 (200 per week)
    
* **Critical systems:** ~80 Payment servers (which must be patched, validated, and handed over within 1–1.5 hours)
    
* **Manual effort:** 4–5 engineers working 2 days in advance just to prepare pre-checks.
    

### Pain points before automation

* **Snapshots:** Each server required a snapshot before patching. Doing this manually for 200 servers took forever.
    
* **Configuration backups:** Application source code, configs, and system info had to be collected one by one.
    
* **Critical servers:** Payment servers couldn’t be down long. Manual patching and validations meant higher risk of delays.
    
* **Validation:** Confirming snapshots and checking post-patching status was repetitive and error-prone.
    

Simply put, the manual approach was:  
⏳ Time-consuming → ❌ Error-prone → 🔥 Stressful → 📉 Inefficient

## What? – Enter Ansible

When **Ansible** came into the picture, everything changed. Instead of manually repeating the same steps across hundreds of servers, we moved to an automated, template-based approach.

We built **playbooks** and **roles** for:

* **Pre-checks template** → Collecting system info, taking backups, creating snapshots.
    
* **Validation template** → Ensuring snapshots were successful before patching.
    
* **Patching & rebooting tasks** → Automating OS updates across servers.
    
* **Post-checks template** → Verifying services, applications, and system health after patching.
    

For **critical servers** (like payment systems), we created optimized playbooks to patch, reboot, validate, and hand over to application teams **within 1–1.5 hours**.

## How? – Manual vs Ansible Approach

### Before Ansible (Manual)

1. Take manual snapshots (200 servers/week).
    
2. Collect system/application backups.
    
3. Apply patches one by one.
    
4. Reboot servers manually.
    
5. Validate manually (services, configs, applications).
    
6. Hand over to application teams.
    

👉 Result: 4–5 people, 2+ days of preparation, risk of human error, missed deadlines.

### After Ansible (Automated)

1. **Run pre-checks playbook** – Automatically:
    
    * Takes snapshots.
        
    * Backs up system/application data.
        
    * Gathers system info.
        
2. **Run validation playbook** – Confirms snapshot success.
    
3. **Run patching & reboot playbook** – Applies updates in batches.
    
4. **Run post-checks playbook** – Ensures system & app health.
    
5. **Generate report** – Ready to share with application teams.
    

👉 Result: Minimal manual effort, consistent process, faster turnaround, reliable results.

## Real-World Impact

* **Time Saved:** What earlier required 4–5 engineers over 2 days now takes a few Ansible runs.
    
* **Consistency:** Same playbooks, same results → no missed steps.
    
* **Faster Handover:** Payment servers patched & validated in **1–1.5 hours** as required.
    
* **Reduced Stress:** Teams spend more time monitoring, less time doing repetitive clicks.
    
* **Scalability:** Whether it’s 80 servers or 800, automation scales without extra manpower.

## Conclusion

This story shows why **automation with Ansible** is not just “nice to have” but **necessary** in large environments. Manual patching for hundreds of servers was slow, error-prone, and stressful. By shifting to Ansible-based templates for pre-checks, patching, and post-checks, we achieved **efficiency, consistency, and speed**—critical for banking customers where downtime directly impacts business.
