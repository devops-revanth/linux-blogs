### Introduction: A Quick Recap and a Personal Note

Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹

Before we dive into todayâ€™s topic, I wanted to share something personal. This blog series started as a way to help myself. After taking a break of almost a year post my last job, I decided to restart my learning journey â€” aiming for certifications. But here's the mistake I made: I kept jumping between courses. Iâ€™d finish 10-15% of one course, then hop onto another, wasting a lot of precious time without real progress.

So I decided to start writing blogs. Why? Because if I can explain something clearly to others, that means Iâ€™ve truly understood it myself. Thatâ€™s my main goal â€” to create easy-to-understand and systematic blogs. Not just for me, but for anyone out there who's in the same boat as I was. ðŸ™Œ

> In our previous blogs, we explored how to install Linux and log in for the first time. If you ran into any issues during the process, feel free to drop a comment below â€” weâ€™ll figure it out together! ðŸ’ª

### Letâ€™s Get Into It: Understanding the Linux Filesystem

Today, weâ€™re going to explore:

* What is a Filesystem?
    
* Understanding File System Structure
    
* Navigating the File System
    
* File System Paths
    

Think of it like this â€” when you install Windows on your laptop or PC, you start working with different drives like \*\*C:\**, \*\*D:\**, or **E:**. Similarly, in Linux, we work with whatâ€™s called a **file system**.

But hereâ€™s a key difference:

> ðŸ§  **In Linux, everything is treated as a file.**  
> Whether itâ€™s a document, directory (folder), a device, or even a process â€” Linux treats it all as files.

This concept is fundamental and forms the base for understanding how Linux organizes and interacts with data.

In future blogs, weâ€™ll also go deeper into:

* How Linux identifies different types of files
    
* Where Linux stores file metadata (like permissions, ownership, etc.)
    
* And how file types are classified
    

But for now, letâ€™s focus on the basics of the Linux file system so we can navigate it like a pro ðŸš€
