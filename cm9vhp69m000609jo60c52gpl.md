Whether you're preparing for an RHCSA/RHCE exam, building your home lab, or managing production systems — this guide equips you with the **clarity and commands** you need to feel at home in any Linux environment.

### 🧭 **System Run Levels in Linux**

#### 🟨 **Why?**

Understanding Linux run levels is critical for system admins to control how the system boots and what services get initialized. It’s especially useful for recovery, maintenance, or switching between CLI and GUI modes.

#### 🟦 **What?**

A **run level** defines a state of the machine based on the services that are running. These run levels are a legacy concept from SysVinit but still influence how `systemd` handles targets in modern distros like RHEL/CentOS 7+.

Here’s a quick rundown of traditional run levels:

| Run Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Halt/shutdown the system |
| 1 | Single-user mode (rescue/maintenance mode) |
| 2 | Multiuser, no networking |
| 3 | Multiuser with networking (CLI only) |
| 5 | Multiuser with networking and GUI |
| 6 | Reboot the system |

In **systemd**, these are mapped to targets like:

* [`runlevel3.target`](http://runlevel3.target) = [`multi-user.target`](http://multi-user.target)
    
* [`runlevel5.target`](http://runlevel5.target) = [`graphical.target`](http://graphical.target)
    

#### 🟩 **How?**

👉 To check the current run level:

```bash
runlevel
```

👉 To change the default run level (target in systemd):

```bash
systemctl get-default
systemctl set-default multi-user.target   # for runlevel 3
systemctl set-default graphical.target    # for runlevel 5
```

👉 To switch to a different target immediately:

```bash
systemctl isolate multi-user.target
```

🔍 **Real-world use case:** You're working on a server without need for GUI. You save resources by setting the system to boot into [**multi-user.target**](http://multi-user.target) instead of [**graphical.target**](http://graphical.target).

## 🚀 **Understanding the Linux Boot Process (The Road to a Running System)**

---

### 🟨 **Why should you care?**

Ever seen a Linux machine stuck at boot with cryptic messages on screen? Or ever needed to change which kernel to boot from? These moments test a Linux admin’s skill.

Knowing **how Linux boots**—step by step—helps you **troubleshoot system failures**, **tune performance**, and even **customize system behavior** (like selecting a different runlevel or adding a splash screen). Since **RHEL/CentOS 7**, the game changed with the introduction of `systemd`.

Let’s dive into the **modern boot sequence**, interactively.

---

### 🟦 **What really happens when you power on a Linux system?**

Let’s take a trip from the press of the power button to the familiar login prompt.

---

👨‍💻 **Step 1: BIOS/UEFI kicks in**

When you hit that power button, the **BIOS** (or **UEFI** on modern machines) starts the party.  
Think of BIOS as the old-school host checking your hardware:  
✅ CPU is ready?  
✅ RAM looks fine?  
✅ Keyboard, drives, etc. are connected?

It runs **POST** (Power-On Self Test) and once happy, it hands over control to the bootloader.  
If UEFI is in use, it goes to the **EFI system partition** instead.

---

🧱 **Step 2: MBR or EFI points to GRUB2**

Once the hardware checks are done, the BIOS looks to the **first sector of your hard drive**—the **MBR (Master Boot Record)** or **EFI partition**—for instructions.

This is where **GRUB2** (our boot manager) lives.

---

🌀 **Step 3: GRUB2 loads up**

Now, GRUB2 takes the wheel. It:

* Displays that menu where you can choose which kernel or OS to boot (useful for recovery!)
    
* Reads its configuration file:
    
    ```bash
    /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    ```
    
* Loads the **Linux kernel** and the **initramfs (initial RAM disk)**
    

Want to change the default boot entry? You edit `grub.cfg` or `/etc/default/grub`.

---

🧠 **Step 4: Kernel time!**

Once GRUB2 gives the green light, the **Linux kernel** is loaded into memory.  
It’s the brain of Linux—initializing your CPU, memory, file systems, and device drivers.

But the kernel can’t handle everything alone yet. That’s where...

---

📦 **Step 5: initramfs/initrd comes in**

The **initramfs** is a compressed archive of essential drivers and tools. It:

* Mounts the real root filesystem
    
* Gets the system ready to transition into full-blown Linux mode
    

It's like a temporary skeleton to get the full body running.

---

⚙️ **Step 6: Hello, systemd (PID 1)**

Now the real fun begins.

The **first process** the kernel starts is `systemd`, and it gets **PID 1**. That’s your **master process**—the new age replacement for the old `init`.

`systemd` checks:

```bash
/etc/systemd/system/default.target
```

This file determines **what state (target)** the system should boot into—whether it's:

* Multi-user with networking ([`multi-user.target`](http://multi-user.target))
    
* Graphical interface ([`graphical.target`](http://graphical.target))
    
* Rescue or emergency modes for debugging
    

It also **starts all services**, mounts file systems, and sets up your login.

---

### 🟩 **How do you interact with and troubleshoot the boot process?**

Here are some super practical commands you’ll use as a sysadmin:

🔍 **Check your current boot target**:

```bash
systemctl get-default
```

🔁 **Change to text-only mode (good for servers)**:

```bash
systemctl set-default multi-user.target
```

💡 **Analyze slow boots**:

```bash
systemd-analyze
systemd-analyze blame
```

🛠 **Recover from broken service boot failures**: Boot into GRUB → edit the boot line → add:

```bash
systemd.unit=rescue.target
```

🔍 **View full boot logs**:

```bash
journalctl -b
```

---

### 📌 Real-world Example

You just updated the kernel on a production server. On reboot, it fails and you’re staring at a GRUB prompt.

🔧 What do you do?

* Select an older working kernel in the GRUB menu
    
* Boot into it
    
* Investigate logs:
    
    ```bash
    journalctl -b -1
    ```
    
* Fix configs or update initramfs if needed:
    
    ```bash
    dracut -f
    ```
    

Reboot. You’ve just **saved downtime** and earned sysadmin brownie points 🏅

## 💬 **Message of the Day (MOTD) – Welcoming Users Like a Pro**

---

### 🟨 **Why does the Message of the Day (MOTD) matter?**

Ever SSH into a system and get greeted with something like:

```bash
Welcome to production-server-1!
Today’s system load is light. Have a productive day.
```

That’s the **Message of the Day**, and it’s more than just decoration. It's your **first chance to communicate with users**, admins, or teammates logging into your server. MOTD can:

* Show **system status**, updates, or alerts
    
* Warn users about **maintenance windows**
    
* Display fun or inspirational messages (hey, we’re human too 😄)
    

A well-set MOTD can make your system feel more **professional, personal, and secure**.

---

### 🟦 **What is MOTD and where is it stored?**

MOTD stands for **Message of the Day**, and it’s simply a **text file** that’s displayed when a user logs in via the terminal or over SSH.

Default location:

```bash
/etc/motd
```

However, it can also be **dynamically generated** using scripts in:

```bash
/etc/profile.d/
```

---

### 🟩 **How do you set a custom MOTD?**

Here’s how to give your Linux system a custom welcome screen 👇

---

#### 🛠 Step-by-step to set a static MOTD

📝 Edit the default MOTD file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/motd
```

🔡 Add your message:

```bash
🚀 Welcome to Durgarevu's Dev Server 🚀
📍 Uptime: $(uptime -p)
💾 Memory Free: $(free -h | grep Mem | awk '{print $4}')
```

💡 Note: Static MOTD doesn't execute shell commands. For dynamic content, use a script instead (next step).

---

#### ⚙️ Set a dynamic MOTD using a shell script

1. **Create a new script** in the `/etc/profile.d/` directory:
    

```bash
sudo nano /etc/profile.d/motd.sh
```

2. **Add your dynamic message content:**
    

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo ""
echo "🌐 Server Name: $(hostname)"
echo "🕐 Time: $(date)"
echo "💡 Tip: Stay curious and keep learning!"
```

3. **Make it executable:**
    

```bash
sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/motd.sh
```

---

#### 🔐 Avoid duplicated MOTD when using SSH

By default, SSH prints `/etc/motd`, but so do login shells. To avoid duplication:

* Edit your SSH config:
    

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

* Find and change:
    

```bash
#PrintMotd yes
```

to:

```bash
PrintMotd no
```

* Restart the SSH service:
    

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
```

---

### 🧪 Real-World Example

Let’s say you manage 20 developers who use SSH daily on a dev server. You want to remind them of a **code freeze every Friday**.

Set this in your dynamic MOTD script:

```bash
echo "⚠️ Reminder: Code Freeze Every Friday at 4 PM. No pushes after that!"
```

Now every developer sees it *before* they start pushing code. No more excuses 😎

---

## 💽 **Disk Partitioning – Slicing Your Storage Like a Pro 🍰**

---

### 🟨 **Why do we need disk partitioning?**

Imagine you're hosting multiple services—web, database, logs—on a single server. Without proper **disk partitioning**, one misbehaving service could hog all the space and crash your system. Not fun.

Partitioning helps you:

* Organize data **logically** (e.g., `/home`, `/var`, `/opt`)
    
* **Prevent one directory** from consuming all space
    
* Improve **security** and **backup** strategies
    
* Set **quotas** and fine-tune **I/O performance**
    

Simply put, partitioning gives you **control and structure**—especially useful for sysadmins and DevOps folks managing real-world Linux servers.

---

### 🟦 **What is disk partitioning in Linux?**

Partitioning is the act of **dividing a hard drive** into distinct regions that the OS can manage separately. Each partition behaves like an independent disk.

Typical Linux partitions include:

* `/` (root): Where your OS lives
    
* `/home`: Users' files
    
* `/var`: Logs, mail, and frequently changing data
    
* `/boot`: Kernel and boot files
    
* `swap`: Virtual memory
    

Partitions are created at install time, but can also be added/modified later using tools like `fdisk` or `parted`.

---

### 🟩 **How to view and create partitions in Linux?**

Let’s walk through **viewing and creating a partition** on a brand new disk.

---

#### 🔍 View existing partitions

```bash
df -h      # Shows mounted filesystems with size
lsblk      # Shows block devices in a tree-like view
sudo fdisk -l   # Shows all partition tables and details
```

Example output:

```bash
Disk /dev/sda: 100 GB
/dev/sda1  *   512MB  Linux boot
/dev/sda2       80GB  Linux LVM
```

---

#### 🛠️ Create a new partition using `fdisk`

Let’s say you've attached a new disk `/dev/sdb`.

1. Open the disk for partitioning:
    

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
```

2. Enter interactive mode:
    

```bash
n   # New partition
p   # Primary
1   # Partition number
<Enter>   # Default start
+10G      # Size of the partition
```

3. Write and exit:
    

```bash
w   # Write changes to disk
```

4. Format the new partition:
    

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
```

5. Mount it:
    

```bash
sudo mkdir /data
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /data
```

6. Make it permanent by editing `/etc/fstab`:
    

```bash
/dev/sdb1    /data    ext4    defaults    0 2
```

---

### 🧪 Real-World Example: Hosting a Large App

You’re deploying a Java-based app that logs heavily into `/opt/app/logs`. Instead of storing logs on `/` (which could fill up fast), you create a **dedicated 20GB partition mounted at** `/opt/app/logs`. This isolates logs and avoids root filesystem overflows.

💡 Pro Tip: Use LVM (Logical Volume Manager) if you want more flexibility (e.g., resizing partitions on the fly).

## 🧩 **Adding Disks in Linux – Expand Your Storage Like a Pro**

---

### 🟨 **Why would you want to scan and add a new disk?**

Adding a new disk isn’t always as simple as plugging it in and seeing it appear.

In the real world (especially in VMs or SAN environments), you might:

* Attach a disk in the **hypervisor (like VMware or KVM)**, but the OS doesn’t see it yet.
    
* Replace or add a disk in a **cloud VM**, and Linux doesn’t pick it up automatically.
    
* Use **storage arrays or external devices**, which often require manual scanning.
    

So... you **scan the SCSI bus** to tell Linux:  
"Hey buddy, check again — I added new hardware!"

---

### 🟦 **What happens when you scan for new disks?**

Linux communicates with the **SCSI subsystem** to detect any changes in the disk landscape.  
This forces a **re-scan of connected devices**, allowing Linux to detect new block devices like `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`, etc.

---

### 🟩 **How to scan and add a new disk (the full process)?**

Let’s go full pro-level here — with disk scanning included.

---

#### 🔹 Step 0: Scan for newly added disks

Before anything else, **rescan the SCSI host(s)**:

```bash
# List SCSI hosts
ls /sys/class/scsi_host/
```

You might see:

```bash
host0  host1  host2
```

Now tell each host to rescan:

```bash
for host in /sys/class/scsi_host/host*; do
  echo "- - -" | sudo tee $host/scan
done
```

This prompts Linux to check for any newly attached storage.

---

#### 🔹 Step 1: List block devices

Check what's been discovered:

```bash
lsblk
```

New disks usually appear as `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`, etc.

---

#### 🔹 Step 2: Partition the disk

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdc
```

Inside the `fdisk` prompt:

```bash
n     # New partition
p     # Primary
1     # Partition number
<Enter>   # Default start sector
+10G      # Size (example)
w         # Write and exit
```

---

#### 🔹 Step 3: Format the partition

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc1
```

You can also use `xfs`, `btrfs`, or others depending on your needs.

---

#### 🔹 Step 4: Create a mount point

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/data
```

---

#### 🔹 Step 5: Mount the partition

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/data
```

---

#### 🔹 Step 6: Make the mount persistent (add to `/etc/fstab`)

```bash
echo '/dev/sdc1 /mnt/data ext4 defaults 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

Now it will auto-mount on boot.

---

### 🧪 Real-World Use Case: Scaling Up Web Servers

You're running a **LAMP stack** on a cloud VM. Your `/var/www` is running out of space as your site content grows.  
So, you add a new 50GB virtual disk in your cloud portal.

➡️ You scan for new devices  
➡️ Partition and format the disk  
➡️ Mount it to `/var/www/html`

🎉 No downtime. Your site gets room to breathe — and grow.

---

💡 **Bonus Tips**:

* Use `lsblk`, `blkid`, and `partprobe` to verify and refresh partition tables.
    
* Consider `LVM` or `RAID` if managing multiple disks or needing flexibility.
    
* Always backup `/etc/fstab` before editing!
