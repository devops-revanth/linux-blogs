Whether you're diving into DevOps, becoming a system admin, or just exploring the world of tech, **Linux** is a skill you *must* know. But before we talk about commands and distributions, let’s start from the very beginning.

In this post, we'll cover:

* What is an Operating System?
    
* What is Linux?
    
* Why Linux?
    
* A Brief History of Linux
    
* Linux Today and its real-world impact
    

## 🖥️ What is an Operating System?

**Before diving into Linux, let’s first understand what an Operating System (OS) is.**

You’ll find tons of textbook definitions out there, but here's a simple and practical way to think about it:

> **An Operating System is the middleman between the hardware and the user.**

It acts as a **bridge**:

* It provides a **User Interface** (UI) so that you can interact with the computer.
    
* It **controls and manages hardware** resources.
    
* It enables **software to function properly** by giving it access to memory, CPU, and other components.
    

### 📱 Where Do We See Operating Systems?

Operating systems are everywhere. You’re likely using one right now! Common examples include:

* 💻 **Desktop OS:** Windows, macOS, Linux
    
* 📱 **Mobile OS:** Android, iOS
    
* 🖥️ **Server OS:** Linux, Windows Server, UNIX
    

Whether it’s your laptop, smartphone, smart TV, or cloud server — everything runs on an operating system.

## 🐧 What is Linux?

Now that we know what an operating system is, let’s talk about **Linux**.

In simple words:

> **Linux is a free and open-source operating system** — just like Windows or macOS, but with some key differences.

### 💡 What Does “Open Source” Mean?

When we say Linux is *open source*, it means:

* The **source code** (the actual code that makes up the OS) is **publicly available**
    
* Anyone can **view, modify, or improve** the code
    
* You can even create your **own version of Linux** based on your needs
    

This freedom is a big reason why Linux is so powerful and flexible.

### 🌍 Linux Comes in Many Flavors (Distributions)

Because it’s open source, many groups and companies have built their own versions of Linux. These are called **distributions (or distros)**.

Each distribution is made for different purposes , here are some:

* 🖥️ Ubuntu – beginner-friendly and desktop-focused
    
* 🏢 Red Hat / AlmaLinux – used in enterprises and data centers
    
* 🛠️ Kali Linux – used for security testing and ethical hacking
    
* 💻 Raspberry Pi OS – runs on tiny computers
    

### 👥 Built by the Community

One of the coolest things about Linux is that it’s not controlled by any single company.  
A **global community of developers and users** contribute to it — fixing bugs, adding features, and helping it grow every day.

## ❓ Why Linux?

So, why should anyone learn or use Linux?  
Here are some **real-world reasons** why Linux is so important — especially in today’s tech world.

### ☁️ Widely Used in Servers and Cloud Computing

Linux is the **#1 choice** for:

* Web servers
    
* Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP
    
* Databases, containers (like Docker), and DevOps tools
    

Most of the internet runs on Linux — quietly powering everything in the background.

### 🏢 Preferred OS in the Corporate World

In many companies, especially in enterprise IT, **Linux is the primary OS** used to host and run applications.  
Whether it’s a banking system, an e-commerce platform, or a social media app — chances are it’s running on Linux.

### 💸 Free Software Philosophy

One of the biggest advantages of Linux:

> **You can download, install, and use Linux completely free.**

No licenses. No subscriptions.  
Compare that to Windows or UNIX, which often require costly licenses.

### 💻 Command Line Power

Most Linux systems are used through the **command line interface (CLI)** — and for good reason:

* It’s **faster**
    
* More **efficient** for automation and scripting
    
* Gives you **full control** over the system
    

👉 If you're a beginner, you can start with the GUI (Graphical User Interface), but to **truly master Linux**, learning the command line is a must.

### ⚡ Performance and Security

Linux is known for:

* 🚀 **Fast performance** (even on older hardware)
    
* 🔐 **Strong security** (less vulnerable to malware and viruses)
    

This is why it’s trusted in production environments, servers, and critical systems.

### 🎨 Customization

Because it’s open source, **you can tweak, modify, or even build your own version** of Linux.  
Want to remove unused features? Add custom functionality? No problem.

### 👨‍💻 Community Support

Stuck somewhere? The **Linux community is huge** and incredibly helpful.  
From online forums to GitHub discussions — you’ll always find support from others who’ve been in your shoes.

### 🧠 Better Understanding of Other Operating Systems

Learning Linux gives you **insight into how operating systems work in general** — making it easier to understand other OSes like macOS, Windows, and even Android (which is based on Linux!).

### 🔧 Must-Have for DevOps

If you're learning DevOps, there's no way around it:

> **Linux is essential.**

Every major DevOps tool — Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform — is built to work on Linux.

## 🕰️ A Brief History of Linux: How It All Began

So far, we’ve looked at:

* What an Operating System is
    
* What Linux is
    
* And why Linux is so important
    

Now, let’s step back in time and see **how Linux actually came to life**.

### 📼 Before Linux… There Was UNIX

Before Linux came into existence, there was **UNIX** — a powerful, multi-user operating system.

* 🏛️ **Developed in the 1970s** at AT&T’s Bell Labs
    
* 👨‍💻 Created by **Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie**
    
* 🚫 UNIX was **not free** — it had **various proprietary versions** with licensing restrictions
    

UNIX laid the foundation for many modern operating systems, but because it was commercial and closed-source, developers wanted something more open.

### 🐂 Enter the GNU Project – 1983

In **1983**, a programmer named **Richard Stallman** launched the **GNU Project**, which stands for:

> **GNU’s Not Unix**

The idea?  
To build a **free and open-source UNIX-like operating system**.

✅ Under the GNU project, many important tools and utilities were created:  
compilers, editors, shell programs, etc.

❌ But one piece was still missing: the **kernel** — the core part of the operating system.

### 👶 The Birth of Linux – 1991

In **1991**, a 21-year-old student from Finland named **Linus Torvalds** started working on a small hobby project:

> A free operating system kernel.

He didn’t expect it to go anywhere big.

📅 On **August 25, 1991**, Linus posted this message in the *Minix* newsgroup:

> "I'm doing a (free) operating system — just a hobby, won't be big and professional like GNU."

### 🔄 Linux Kernel Versions & Evolution

* 🧪 **Version 0.01** – Released in **September 1991**
    
    * It wasn’t functional but was **shared with the public** for feedback
        
* ⚙️ **Version 0.02** – Released later in 1991
    
    * It was **functional** and could run some basic commands
        
    * Combined with **GNU utilities**, it formed a **complete, usable, free operating system**
        

### 🤝 Linux + GNU = Complete OS

So while **Linux** refers to the **kernel** developed by Linus Torvalds,  
it’s the **combination of the Linux kernel + GNU tools** that gave us the full OS we call “Linux” today.

And the rest is history...

From a hobby project to the OS that powers supercomputers, servers, smartphones, and the cloud —  
**Linux has truly changed the world**.

## 🌐 **Linux Today: Where It Stands and Why It’s More Relevant Than Ever**

Linux has come a long way from a hobby project to becoming the **backbone of modern technology**. In this post, let’s explore where Linux stands today and why it’s **absolutely essential** in 2025 and beyond.

### 💻 Linux Is Everywhere!

You may not “see” Linux every day, but it’s *literally everywhere*:

### 🚀 Servers & Supercomputers

* **90%+ of cloud servers** run on Linux
    
* **Top 500 supercomputers** in the world use Linux
    
* From Google to Facebook to Netflix — they all run Linux behind the scenes
    

### 📱 Mobile Devices

* Your **Android phone**? It’s powered by the **Linux kernel**.
    
* Android is the most widely used mobile OS globally — that means **Linux runs on billions of devices**.
    

### 🛰️ Embedded Systems

* Routers, TVs, smartwatches, home automation systems — even your **Wi-Fi router** or **TV remote** might be running a lightweight Linux distro.
    

### 🌩️ Cloud & DevOps

* **AWS**, **Azure**, **GCP** — all favor Linux for deploying apps and services.
    
* Tools like **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Ansible**, and **Terraform** all run best (and sometimes only) on Linux.
