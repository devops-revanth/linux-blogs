In our previous blogs, we’ve built a strong foundation:

* We understood **what an Operating System is** and how it works as a bridge between user and hardware.
    
* We explored **what Linux is**, **why it’s powerful**, and the **history** of how it all started with Linus Torvalds’ humble hobby project.
    
* We also looked at **how Linux evolved over time** and where it stands today in real-world systems like cloud, servers, embedded devices, and more.
    

Now, let’s continue our Linux learning journey by answering three important things:

1. **How does Linux differ from Unix?**
    
2. **How does Linux compare to Windows?**
    
3. **And what are some important things you must know before starting hands-on with Linux?**
    

## 🆚 Linux vs Unix – What's the Difference?

When learning Linux, one common question people have is: *How is Linux different from Unix?*  
Let’s simplify it.

#### 🛠️ **Origins & History**

* **Unix** was developed in the **1970s** at **Bell Labs** by **AT&T**, **GE**, and **MIT**. It was a **multi-user, multitasking operating system**, mainly used in enterprise-level environments.
    
* **Linux** was created later in **1991** by **Linus Torvalds**, who built it as a **free and open-source** alternative to Unix.
    

#### 💰 **Cost & Licensing**

* **Linux** is mostly **free** to use and **open-source**, which means anyone can download, modify, and share it.
    
* **Unix** is usually **proprietary**, and licenses can be **expensive**. It’s controlled by specific vendors.
    

#### 🏢 **Who Uses Them?**

* **Unix** is used in specific commercial systems like:
    
    * **Solaris** (developed by Sun Microsystems, now owned by Oracle)
        
    * **HP-UX** (Hewlett-Packard)
        
    * **AIX** (IBM)
        
* **Linux** is used by a **huge open-source community**, individual developers, and companies like:
    
    * **Red Hat**, **Debian**, **Ubuntu**, **CentOS**, **Arch**, etc.
        

#### 💾 **File System Support**

* **Unix** supports **fewer file systems**, mainly depending on the vendor.
    
* **Linux** supports a **wide range of file systems**, including **ext3**, **ext4**, **XFS**, **Btrfs**, **ZFS**, and more.
    

#### 💻 **Hardware Compatibility**

* **Linux** can be installed on **almost any hardware** — from:
    
    * Mobile phones
        
    * Tablets
        
    * Gaming consoles
        
    * Laptops & Desktops
        
    * Even **mainframes** and **supercomputers**
        
* **Unix** usually runs on **specific hardware** that’s certified by the vendor.
    

## 🆚 Linux vs Windows – A Simple Comparison

Linux and Windows are two of the most popular operating systems, but they’re **very different** in terms of structure, usage, and philosophy. Let’s break it down:

#### 🔓 **Availability of Source Code**

* **Linux**: Fully **open-source** – you can view, edit, and customize the source code.
    
* **Windows**: **Proprietary software** – owned and maintained by Microsoft; source code is closed.
    

#### 💰 **Cost**

* **Linux**: Completely **free** to use and distribute.
    
* **Windows**: **Paid license** required (can be costly for multiple systems).
    

#### 🖥️ **User Interface**

* **Linux**: Offers **multiple desktop environments** like **GNOME**, **KDE**, **XFCE**, allowing deep customization.
    
* **Windows**: Has a **standard GUI** across all versions, providing a consistent experience.
    

#### 💻 **Command Line Interface**

* **Linux**: The **command line is central** to the system; many tasks are done via terminal.
    
* **Windows**: Offers **Command Prompt and PowerShell**, but these are **less commonly used** by everyday users.
    

#### 📦 **Software Installation & Package Management**

* **Linux**: Uses **package managers** like `APT`, `YUM`, `DNF`, `Pacman` to install and update software.
    
* **Windows**: Uses **.exe installers**, and most software is manually downloaded and installed.
    

#### 🔐 **Security**

* **Linux**: Considered **more secure** due to:
    
    * Strong user permissions
        
    * Open-source community vigilance
        
    * Fewer targeted attacks
        
* **Windows**: More prone to **malware**, mainly because it's widely used, making it a **bigger target**.
    

#### ⚙️ **System Stability & Performance**

* **Linux**: Known for **rock-solid stability**; servers often run **for years without rebooting**.
    
* **Windows**: Generally stable, but can **slow down over time**, especially with regular updates and third-party software.
    

#### 🗂️ **File Systems**

* **Linux**: Uses **ext4**, **XFS**, **Btrfs**, etc.
    
* **Windows**: Uses **NTFS** and **FAT32**.
    

## 📌 Important Things to Know Before You Start Using Linux

Before you start installing Linux or diving deeper into commands and systems, here are a few **essential things to keep in mind**:

#### 🔐 1. **The Root User – Superpowers of Linux**

* In Linux, the `root` account is the **superuser**, just like **Administrator** in Windows.
    
* It has **full control** over the system – can **create, modify, or delete users**, change critical system files, and more.
    
* **Be careful** when logged in as root — one wrong command can break your system.
    

#### 🔤 2. **Linux is Case-Sensitive**

* Unlike Windows, **Linux treats uppercase and lowercase letters as different**.
    
* Example: `File.txt`, `file.txt`, and `FILE.TXT` are all **different files** in Linux.
    

#### 🧩 3. **Avoid Spaces in File/Folder Names**

* It’s a good habit to avoid using spaces when naming files or directories.
    
* Instead of: `My File.txt`, use: `my_file.txt` or `MyFile.txt`.
    

#### 🧠 4. **The Linux Kernel is Not the OS**

* **Linux Kernel** is the **core of the operating system** – it handles communication between software and hardware.
    
* It’s not the complete OS by itself. The full Linux OS includes the kernel + software + utilities (often from the GNU project).
    
* We'll explore more about the **kernel** in upcoming blogs.
    

#### 💻 5. **CLI (Command Line Interface) is King**

* While some Linux distributions offer a **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**, most professionals use the **CLI (Terminal)**.
    
* The CLI is **powerful, fast**, and gives you full control over the system.
    

#### 🔧 6. **Linux is Highly Flexible**

* One of the reasons Linux is so loved is because it's **flexible and customizable**.
    
* You can choose your desktop environment, system tools, even modify the OS itself to suit your needs!
    

## ✅ That’s a Wrap!

With this blog, you've now learned:

* The **difference between Linux, Unix, and Windows**
    
* Key **technical comparisons**
    
* And **things to remember before you get your hands dirty** with Linux
